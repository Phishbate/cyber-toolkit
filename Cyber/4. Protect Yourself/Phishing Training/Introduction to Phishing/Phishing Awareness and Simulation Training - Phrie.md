## Master your employee's digital impulse

Technology helps your team work faster but it also ramps up people’s compulsion to click without blinking or thinking. It takes just one uneducated click to open your business’ virtual door to a corporate hacker and bypass your expensive software defences. Don’t risk data theft, exposure or extortion because of unschooled staff.

*Just weeks after hackers had stolen the personal details of 76 million customers of a multinational bank, 20% of bank staff clicked on a simulated phishing email. At that average rate, even a small workforce of 200 would provide cybercrims with 40 avenues to access corporate data.*
