**What you need to do**

Provide cyber security awareness training to new staff. Provide reminder training at least once a year to all staff.

The content of awareness training may vary depending on the specific risks your organisation will likely face. Awareness programs for all staff should cover the following topics as a minimum:

- Malicious software (malware) – unauthorised software including viruses, spyware, trojans and worms designed to cause harm to your devices
- Scam emails (phishing) – emails, SMS or social media messages that attempt to mimic individuals or organisations you may know. They trick you to click on a link or an attachment and ask you to provide personal information (passwords or credit card numbers) or pay a fake account. These emails can also include attachments designed to look genuine, but which contain malware
- Ransomware – a specific type of malware that locks down your computer and files on it until a ransom is paid
- Good practices when it comes to cyber security – using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, backing up data and using automatic updates
- Responding to an incident – what staff should do if they detect a potential security incident and where to reported it.

There may be other topics that are relevant to specific staff, depending on the way your business operates. Advise these staff about all the cyber security risks that apply to them. Staff who are at a heightened risk will vary depending on your business, but may include:

- Travellers  
- Staff working from home  
- Staff with a significant public profile  
- Staff who manage your business’ financial accounts  
- Staff with elevated access to your business’ systems via administrative accounts

**Why is this important?**

Many cyber security breaches are mostly caused by human error – clicking on a malicious link or attachment in an email. Training your staff to understand and avoid common security threats is important in reducing the risk of cyber security incidents.

Some staff may have a higher level of risk of being targeted, simply because of the nature of their role. It's important to make these staff aware and the steps they can take to help manage this risk.
