We transmit a lot of valuable information via our WiFi connections. As such it’s important to remain mindful of the possibility that anyone can fraudulently access this communication medium; especially if it is unsecured. Once an attacker has access to your WiFi connection, they may gain the ability to view your computer files, monitor your online activity, infect your system with malware and use your Internet connection for fraudulent purposes, such as spam or phishing campaigns.   
  
It is crucial that you and your colleagues are always operating via a secure WiFi connection, especially considering the advent of remote working in the new decade.

Your organisation may choose to provide a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) for the benefit of clients and visitors. You need to keep such WLAN secure.

Please see our recommended checklist of WLAN settings below:

- Separate WiFi from your business network (Guest Network)
- Separate from your business network (BYOD Network)
- Change default administrator settings
- Set your router to use WiFi Protected Access 2 (WPA-2)
- Change default IP addresses of access point
- Change vendor default settings for Service Set Identifier (SSID)
- Change WiFi password after staff departure / every 6 months
- Change administrator wireless access points passwords every 6 months.

We also recommend that you share our Cyber Aware Secure WiFi Checklist with your IT manager, service provider, or person(s) responsible for workplace WiFi, and ensure that each point is implemented. Below is a template for sharing the resource and opening up the conversation:
