# Removable Media Instruction Manual

Removable media such as USB flash drives, external hard drives, and SD cards have become a common way of storing and transferring data. While these devices offer convenience, they also pose significant cyber security risks. In this instruction manual, we will highlight the potential risks associated with the use of removable media and provide guidelines on how to mitigate these risks.

## Cyber Security Risks Associated with Removable Media

### Malware Infections

Removable media can carry malware infections that can easily spread to your computer or network. Malware can be introduced to your system by simply inserting an infected removable media device. The malware can then spread to other devices on the network and cause serious damage.

### Data Theft

Removable media can also be used to steal data. An attacker may use a removable media device to copy sensitive data from your computer or network and then use it for malicious purposes.

Removable media can be used to share illegal or unauthorized content. Employees may use removable media devices to share copyrighted content or confidential information with unauthorized individuals or groups.

## Guidelines for Mitigating Cyber Security Risks

### Use Trusted Devices

Only use removable media devices from trusted sources. You should also scan all devices for malware before using them on your computer or network.

### Encrypt Sensitive Data

Encrypt all sensitive data that is stored on removable media devices. This will ensure that even if the device is lost or stolen, the data cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals.

### Implement a Removable Media Policy

Implement a removable media policy that outlines acceptable use and security guidelines for removable media devices. This policy should be communicated to all employees and strictly enforced.

### Monitor and Audit Removable Media Use

Monitor and audit the use of removable media devices on your network. This will help you detect any unauthorized activity and take appropriate action.

## Conclusion

The use of removable media devices can offer convenience, but it also poses significant cyber security risks. By following the guidelines outlined in this instruction manual, you can mitigate the risks associated with removable media and protect your computer and network from potential threats.
