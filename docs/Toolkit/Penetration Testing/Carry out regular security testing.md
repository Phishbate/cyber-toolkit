##### What you need to do

Determine which parts of your IT environment may need security testing:

- identify internal or internet-facing systems that either host important data or applications, or support critical business operations. If some of these are cloud-based, then your cloud service provider may do security testing. Check with them.
- the importance of testing your website will vary. It will be more critical to test if your website is transactional than if it is static. Transactional websites are more at risk as they have sensitive or confidential data and more avenues for a cyber attack. Transactional websites include those which sell to the public or other businesses.

Identify who will do the security testing and how it will be done:

- there are a range of security testing options â€“ from free scanning services (many are available online) to customised services. Many free services provide a good starting point, but may not identify all potential security issues with your systems / website.
- engaging a security expert specialising in security testing services can ensure a tailored solution is developed for your business' needs. The testing may be more detailed and provide guidance on prioritising remedial work for any security issues identified.

If you're already using a managed service provider, speak to them about your business' security testing needs.

- your business' public website(s)
- any internet-facing systems that provide access into your business.
