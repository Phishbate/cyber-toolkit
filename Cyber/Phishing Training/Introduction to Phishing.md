# Ways to Avoid Phishing

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where cybercriminals trick people into clicking on a link or giving away sensitive information. Here are some ways to avoid being a victim of phishing:

1. Be cautious of emails from unfamiliar senders. If you receive an email from someone you don't know, do not click on any links or download any attachments.
2. Check the URL of the website you are visiting. Make sure it is spelled correctly and that the website is legitimate.
3. Avoid sharing sensitive information online. Do not share your passwords, social security numbers, or any other personal information on social media or other online platforms.
4. Keep your computer and software up-to-date. Install the latest updates and patches to ensure that your computer is protected from known vulnerabilities.
5. Use anti-virus software and firewalls. These tools can help detect and prevent phishing attacks.
6. Be aware of common phishing scams. Phishing attacks often use urgent language, threats, or requests for personal information to lure victims into clicking on a link or giving away sensitive information.
7. Educate yourself and others. Learn about different types of phishing attacks and how to recognize them. Share this information with your friends, family, and coworkers to help prevent them from becoming victims.

By following these tips, you can protect yourself from phishing attacks and keep your personal information safe.
