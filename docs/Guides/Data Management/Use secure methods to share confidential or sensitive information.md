**What you need to do**

Some methods of information sharing are more secure than others but none are 100% infallible:

Emails

File sharing tools

Popular file-sharing tools such as Dropbox [https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/share/set-folder-permissions], Google Drive [https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308868?hl=en] and OneDrive [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-onedrive-

files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07] are used by many businesses to share information. It’s critical to make sure you use file-sharing tools securely. Things to keep in mind include:

Share the file only with the people who need to see it  
Password protect the shared file and share the password by phone or password manager Disable downloads to limit copies being downloaded without your permission  
Set an expiry date for any shared links to prevent people from accessing it after that date

Most file-sharing tools can prevent anyone else from gaining access, even if they have a link to the file. This is useful if the link gets forwarded on to other people without your permission.

External USB drives

Consider encrypting the information before you store it on the USB drive and then share it. Microsoft Office files have a Password ProtectFeature [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/protect-a-document-with-a-password-05084cc3-300d-4c1a-8416- 38d3e37d6826]. Only share the password with those you trust – by phone or password manager.

You can purchase USB drives that have encryption built in. You'll need to set a pin code and provide that to the recipient so they can access the contents.

Paper-based sharing

You may sometimes need to share sensitive information using hard copies of documents. You should:

limit the number of hard copies you create  
ask the recipient to securely destroy the documents when they no longer need them, by shredding them consider using one of the electronic methods of sharing information instead of by paper.

Helpful guidance

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides detailed guidance and step-by-step instructions to help you understand and implement recommended actions:

Why is this important?

Data breaches can occur where a business engages in ways of sharing sensitive information that are insecure.

There's an increasing number of regulations around the way businesses handle sensitive information. It's important to be aware of and practice robust methods for sharing information securely. This can help limit the potential for that information to fall into the wrong hands, which may cause you, your customers or partners harm. It could even expose your business to financial penalties.
