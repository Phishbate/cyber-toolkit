This step is one of the most important phases in the incident response process, and the one that is most often overlooked. Learning from each incident enables the IMT to continually improve its processes and procedures for managing cyber incidents.<br><br>The IMT (and SEMT, if activated) should come together for a Post Incident Review to discuss:<br><br>▪     Exactly what happened, and at what times?<br><br>▪     How well did staff and management perform in dealing with the incident? Were the documented procedures followed? Were they adequate?<br><br>▪     What information was needed sooner?<br><br>▪     Were any steps or actions taken that might have inhibited the recovery?<br><br>▪     What would the staff and management do differently the next time a similar incident occurs?<br><br>▪     How could information sharing with other organisations have been improved?<br><br>▪     What corrective actions can prevent similar incidents in the future?<br><br>▪     What precursors or indicators should be watched for in the future to detect similar incidents?<br><br>▪     What additional tools or resources are needed to detect, analyse, and mitigate future incidents?<br><br>The discussion should be documented and any key insights / lessons learnt shared with all parties involved. Any recommendations to arise from the discussion should be documented in a corresponding action plan that states how the recommendation will be actioned, by whom and when.|
