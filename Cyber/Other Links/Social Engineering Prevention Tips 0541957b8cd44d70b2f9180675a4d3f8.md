**Be suspicious of people you don’t know who ask for sensitive information.** 
 “Social engineers” use lies and manipulation to trick people into giving away sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. Don’t fall for it! Follow these best practices: always maintain a healthy sense of skepticism when dealing with unknown individuals, especially if they ask for any internal or sensitive information.

**Be on guard against anyone who asks for sensitive information.**
 Social engineers may try to trick you into giving away sensitive information, such as user login names and passwords or credit card numbers. They can attempt to gather the data by using email, SMS messaging, or in person. They may also attempt to enter the workplace by disguising as maintenance or delivery personnel. Remain on guard and verify the identity of any person making an unsolicited request before you provide information by phone, email, or in person.

**Don’t trust someone on the basis of a business card.** 
 Fake business cards may be used by social engineers to gain access to certain areas. If someone gives you a business card, you should still verify the information on the card. Do not take a business card as proof that someone should be allowed to access any confidential information or private areas. If you don’t feel right about something, report it.

**Beware of fake identity thief recovery services.**
 After an incident of identity theft, you may get a call from a telemarketer offering to help you recover your stolen money or offering a service that will help secure you from future identity theft. These telemarketers are con artists who specifically target victims of identity theft. They will not recover your money; they will simply ask you to pay them for their services and will take additional money from you. Hang up immediately. Don’t become a victim twice! You may want to research and obtain the services of a reputable identity theft recover company. You should initiate the call, not the recovery company.

**Never let another person follow you into a restricted area.**
 Tailgating is when one person follows another person in after the first person has used their badge or key card. This often happens during times when there are many people entering the organization at the same time. You should never let another person follow you into a restricted area, even if you have seen this person use their own badge or key card before; their credentials may have been revoked and you have no way of knowing.

**Verify the identity of anyone who asks you for your confidential information.**
 Social engineering is the art of tricking people into revealing data to those who are not authorized to access it. Social engineers may pose as security technicians, for example, or officials at your bank or data center and then ask you for your login information. Always verify their identity before giving out your information. Call the person back at a number you have determined to be legitimate or check an individual’s government-issued photo ID when meeting in person before you release your personal details. Follow your organization’s security policy when considering what information, you would be asked to provide.

**Social engineers may use your personal information against you. Never trust anyone who doesn’t have the appropriate credentials.**
 Social engineers are individuals who will call you and pretend to be either within your organization or with a service that is attempting to work with your organization. They will often pretend to need confidential information from you and will claim to have the clearance to access this information. Most legitimate organizations will never ask for this type of information. A social engineer might call and say that they are troubleshooting your web service and need an administrative password; they may use your social media to determine your position within the organization, so always be careful what you post. Never give out any information to anyone without verification of their credentials from management.

**Never lend out your access badge or key card.**
 You should never let anyone else use your access badge or key card, regardless of the situation. If you lose your badge or card, immediately report it to security so that it can be disabled.

**If you see someone without a badge in a restricted location, report it immediately.** 
 Security may be compromised physically rather than digitally by intruders. You should always report anyone suspicious you see in a restricted location. Someone without a badge or someone attempting to access a location without the appropriate credentials may be attempting to steal information or physical items from the organization.

**Social engineers prey on the good-mannered. Don’t be afraid to say “no.”**
 If someone asks you to give them personal information access to confidential information, don’t be afraid to be direct and say no. Anyone suspicious should be denied access until you can verify their identity.

**Your access badge could be used by a malicious insider. Always know where your badge is.**
 Someone inside the organization — including both coworkers and visitors — could use your access badge to reach confidential organization data. Always ensure your badge is on your person at all times. Wearing your badge at all times is the best way to avoid losing it. If your badge does go missing, report it lost immediately. This is true even if you find your badge again later; the badge could be taken, used and then returned.

**Don’t allow others to follow you through secure entryways without swiping their own access card.**
 Everyone must swipe their own ID access cards. If they still refuse to swipe their ID access card, notify security and provide them with the details of the event. Most of these entry control systems record an audit trail of who enters, which door, and when.

**Never leave your ID badge or key card unguarded.** 
 These items should be worn or with you at all times and never lent out. If you lose your ID badge or key card, report it as soon as you realize one of these items is missing.

**Social engineers will attempt to convince you to let them into secure buildings even though they don’t have a key card or key code. Don’t fall for it!** 
 Malicious individuals who want to steal our physical or information assets often try to get into our facilities by posing as a fellow employee or a vendor who lost his or her card key. They’ve even been known to dress as repair technicians, complete with fake uniforms with the logo of an actual vendor. If someone without a keycard asks you to let them into a secured building, rather than just letting them in, offer to contact security or your supervisor who can verify their identity and grant them access to the building if it’s appropriate to do so.

**Never give out information without verifying the identity of the person requesting it.**
 A social engineer is a person who attempts to get confidential information purely through social skills, such as by calling and asking for passwords or other sensitive information. They will often claim to be a member of your organization or an organization that works directly with you and may even know detailed information about your organization and your coworkers. Never give out information, such as passwords, to anyone without verifying their identity first. When in doubt, consult your supervisor.

**If you are hosting a visitor, be sure the visitor signs in at the front desk and is escorted at all times.** 
 Visitors should also always wear a visitor badge and return the visitor badge before leaving.

**If you see someone without an ID or visitor badge, politely escort the person to the security desk for sign in or report it to security right away.**
 Identification badges help keep criminals and other malicious people out of our facilities by letting everyone know who belongs in our facilities and who doesn’t. By recognizing and reporting anyone who does not have an ID badge, you’re helping keep our facilities safe and secure.

**Social engineers gain your trust then request sensitive information. Always be skeptical when speaking with unknown people.**
 Anyone can call to ask you for sensitive information. Social engineers will often call and pretend to work for your organization. Some of them may even be able to give you details about your department, your position, and the information they need. It’s important to never release any information to someone who you don’t know and who has not had their credentials verified. When you are talking to a new person, you should verify their identity and get authorization to share information with them from a supervisor.

**Always maintain a healthy sense of skepticism when dealing with unknown individuals, especially if they ask for sensitive information.**
 The social engineering basic strategy is to prey on vulnerabilities in human nature, such as trust, fear, politeness, and helpfulness, rather than technical vulnerabilities in computer programs. Social engineers have done their research and are experts in manipulation. For example, an attacker may try to build rapport with you by finding common interests, and then ask you for a “favor,” or an attacker may call you pretending to be an executive in order to exploit your tendency to comply with authority figures.

**If you are suspicious about a call, ask for more information and report the incident to IT security.**
 Anyone can call and ask for information. If you believe that someone is attempting to get sensitive information from you or to get you to complete a task that could lead to a security breach, ask them for their name, number, and what they want. Report the incident to IT security before fulfilling any of their requests. The IT security department will let you know if the request was legitimate.

**Scammers may keep contacting you even after you’ve rebuked them. Block them to reduce the possibility of issues in the future.**
 Once you have identified someone as a scammer you should block them to prevent them from contacting you again. On most instant messenger services, you can simply right-click on the person’s name and then select the “block” option. This will ensure that they cannot contact you or even see you online. You can also block emails by going into your options and adding the person’s email address to your “Blocked Addresses” lists. If you do not block a scammer, they may continue bothering you or sending you potentially harmful files and links.

**Scams may be disguised as investment opportunities. Be skeptical of any investment opportunities you receive through email.** 
 If you receive an unsolicited investment opportunity through email, it’s very likely a fraud. These scams often claim to be able to make you large amounts of money in short amounts of time or with a very small initial investment. You should ignore any investment opportunities that you have not inquired directly about. If it seems to be too good to be true, it probably is.

**Con artists may approach you with free prizes that require hidden fees. Never accept a free prize that has a catch.**
 If you have won a free prize, the prize should be entirely free. Con artists may attempt to scam you out of money by claiming that you have won a prize but that you need to pay government taxes or customs fees on the value of the item. You will either never receive the item or end up paying more than the item is truly worth. If someone offering you a prize tells you that you need to pay them for taxes, shipping or any other hidden fees, it is a scam. Do not continue speaking with this individual and do not send them any money.

**Report any instances of fraud or attempted fraud you become aware of.**
 If you notice something “just a little off” in the records, or in another person’s actions, this might be an indication of inappropriate or suspicious activities. There may be a simple and innocent mistake, or there may be something much more serious happening. Report these peculiarities to management and allow them to take a closer look as necessary.
