## Phishing

### What is phishing?

Phishing is a type of cybercrime where an attacker pretends to be a trustworthy source in order to retrieve sensitive information from a victim, such as passwords, data or credit card numbers.

There are several ways a hacker can try to phish someone. Some examples include: via email , by phone (vishing = voice), or by text message (smishing = sms).

This data is used for identity theft, spam, fraud or corporate espionage.

### What kinds of phishing are there?

Phishing includes every attempt a hacker makes to steal sensitive data while impersonating a trustworthy source.

When we talk about **phishing**, we use it as an umbrella term and to refer to phishing by email specifically.

When we use the term **smishing**, it refers to smishing by text message. It derives from the abbreviation for sms phishing.

**Vishing** is used to referred to phishing by phone. It is derived from voice phishing.

**Spear phishing** is targeted towards a specific person or group, as compared to mass phishing campaigns. For example: when someone tries to lure employees from a specific company into a trap using an email that impersonates a colleague.

**Whaling** is spear phishing targeted at a company’s decision makers, the ‘big fish’.

**CEO fraud** is phishing disguised as a message coming from your manager. Because of the sender’s apparent authority, people are more likely to walk into the trap.

There are other types as well, which are included and explained in the **Phished Academy**.

### Why is phishing dangerous?

Phishing is one of the most dangerous forms of cybercrime because it cannot be detected by regular antivirus software. Phishing scammers do not need to infect your computer system with a virus to obtain sensitive information. All they need is a trusting employee who reveals the data unsuspectingly.

If your organisation experiences a phishing-incident and that information reaches the media, the company’s brand image is immediately affected. Customers are concerned about the security of their personal data processed by the company and lose confidence in the brand.

### How do I recognise phishing?

It’s not as easy to recognise phishing as it used to be. Some general pointers:

Check the sender’s address: are there typo’s or irregularities there? Only trust addresses that are 100% correct. Otherwise, it’s probably a **typosquatting** attempt.

Check any hyperlinks by hovering over them: do they point to the website you would expect? If not, don’t click it.

Does the content or request fall outside the boundaries of what you might expect from this sender? Don’t engage with it, but alert IT.

Unsure? Always contact your IT department.

### What do I do when I was phished?

**General steps**

Try to remain calm and inform your internal IT-department about the attack. If the attack was a phishing email, you should report it as spam and send it to **phishing@clientname.domain**. Have your computer, tablet or smartphone checked by your internal (or external) IT service.

**For data**

This step is applicable if you entered data during the attack: scan your system, change your password for the accounts involved and stay alert for possible misuse of the data involved.

**For downloads**

This step is applicable if you downloaded a file during the attack: don’t open the installed file and delete it immediately, disconnect your computer from any network (disconnect your WIFI or unplug your ethernet cable) and scan your entire system.

## Platform

### What is Phished?

Phished is an AI-driven platform that focuses on the human side of cybersecurity. By combining fully automated training software with personalised, realistic simulations of cyberattacks, Phished teaches your employees how to correctly and safely deal with online threats. Because of this, employees are better prepared and more secure, the data, reputation and assets of organisations are more secure.

### 4 layers of The Human Firewall

Phished helps companies by training their employees to recognise and deal with cyber threats. It does this by focusing on the 4 layers of The Human Firewall.

**Automated Phishing Simulations**: Our AI training software sends out fully automated phishing simulations based on the profile and behaviour of each individual employee.

**Phished Academy**: When employees trip up, they are trained with micro learnings from the Phished Academy. We develop their sense of responsibility, to avoid having them make the same mistakes in the future.

**Activation**: Employees don’t just have to undergo the phishing simulations, they can also flag them in a simple way. It engages them in their organisation’s cybersecurity approach.

**Reporting**: Thanks to our in-depth reporting tools, you remain one step ahead of cyber criminals. Our reporting methods let you pinpoint the exact locations of security threats within your organization.

### Who is it for?

Because of its scalability, Phished is suitable for every kind of organisation, from SME to Enterprise, from Public Institution to Non-Profit. Whether your organisation trains 5 employees or 50,000, everyone will benefit from the same rigorous, in-depth, automated and personalised approach, thanks to our powerful AI. Learn more on our [Solutions page](https://phished.io/solutions).

### How does it work?

The algorithm draws up a phishing profile and a phishing score for every individual. The AI sends out its initial simulations based on the function of the employee. Next, the algorithm will take into account each individual’s behaviour and intelligently adapt its approach in the subsequent simulations. Which simulations does the recipient report? Which emails does the recipient engage with? Does he click on any hyperlinks? How long does an employee have the mail open for, before realising he or she is looking at simulation? Using big data, the algorithm learns which simulations particularly appeal to each individual recipient.

### Is the AI always up to date?

The algorithm receives fresh input every day. By now, the platform features thousands of tailor-made simulations, with new ones being added on a daily basis. Phished employs content experts who specialize in this particular domain. They use topical issues *(share a recent example, for instance a newsletter from a daily to promote a football game, free train tickets from the government...)* and use data from actual cyberattacks.

### What kind of automation is there?

The Phished platform works fully automated, unburdening IT administrators while keeping their co-workers in top shape. Phishing simulations are automatically send out and personalised per recipient, making sure that every employee is alerted to their blind spots and training their cybersecurity knowledge. The Phished Academy is based on the same principles: recipients learn according to their own personal experience and knowledge.

Reporting is automated as well: administrators receive a handy overview per recipient, per function, per department, per location or per language. They can choose to receive this regularly in their email inbox.

### How can Phished work with personalisation if it’s automated?

The AI tracks each recipient’s behaviour related to our platform. By identifying weaknesses, while taking individual’s experience and knowledge into account, the algorithm sends automated, yet personalised simulations and Phished Academy learning materials to every single recipient as needed. By linking automated and personalised phishing simulations to our training software and actively involving recipients in the security process, Phished teaches employees to properly deal with actual online threats.

### How can I keep track of my organisation’s performance?

Phished offers an unrivalled insight into the performance of your individual employees, job functions, departments, locations and can even offer you a comparison with similar (anonymised) competitors.

### What is a Phished rate?

A person’s ‘**phished rate**’ is a representation of his or her performance with Phished simulations. Someone who consistently spots phishing simulations will score higher than someone who is regularly phished. Reporting simulations helps to raise this score, as well as not clicking on malicious links or entering data.

### Do customers need to manually maintain their account after they start using the platform?

Our focus is on ease of use and automation, which is no different when it comes to onboarding and maintenance. That is the strength of Phished: as little manual work as possible for clients. To reduce the number of necessary logins even more, administrators can opt to receive reports automatically at regular intervals via email.

The Phished platform supports both manual and automatic additions to the recipients’ list. This can be done either through a .CSV or .XLS file, by using the manual interface or by using the Azure Active Directory API.

### What is the Phished Academy?

The Phished Academy forms the second layer of our Human Firewall. It educates users on various cybersecurity topics, ranging from phishing and ransomware to safe password usage and preventing malware. It is as much a prevention tool as a reactive measure to teach people how to recognise cyber threats. It works automated and personalises learning materials according to individual recipients’ strengths and weaknesses.

### How does the automation work?

The Phished Academy can be used proactively by the administrator to help their co-workers understand the threats within the cybersecurity world. It can also be used to help phished employees better understand what they are up against and it will instruct them on how they can [prevent phishing](https://phished.io/blog/how-to-prevent-a-new-phishing-attack-on-your-business) errors in the future. Learning materials are automatically personalised to match the user’s experience and knowledge.

### How does the Phished Academy help raise cyber awareness?

As soon as employees start entering data, clicking on links when they shouldn’t or downloading files, their behaviour is adjusted through micro learnings, to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. The Phished Academy features 450+ pieces of content about the ways in which employees can protect themselves online. The Academy goes beyond phishing, touching on themes like privacy and ransomware as well.

Another feature of the Phished Academy is that administrators can proactively choose to approach the users who score less than 80% in their phishing profile.

### Does the Phished Academy focus solely on phishing?

No: the Phished Academy educates your employees on a broad range of cybersecurity topics. They learn more about the how and why of ransomware, malware, data breaches, GDPR,… and of course phishing is dealt with as well.
