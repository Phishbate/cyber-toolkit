Depending on the impact and severity of a cyber incident, it may be necessary to communicate with external stakeholders (including ministers, media and the public). This is particularly important if the incident affects IT networks, systems or applications relied upon by third-parties, such as public facing websites or services.

Key messages to consider when communicating with external stakeholders include:
What happened and why did it happen?

- What systems/services are affected?
- What steps are being taken to resolve the situation?
- Is it possible to say when the situation will be resolved?
- What are external stakeholders expected to do?
- Who can external stakeholders contact if they have questions/concerns?

All external communications must be reviewed and approved by <communications lead and the Incident Manager> prior to release. If the SEMT is activated, the SEMT Chair should approve all external communications prior to release.|
