**What you need to do**

For any business, the simplest thing that can be done to help identify and detect potential security issues is:

- having antivirus software installed on all systems  
- making sure it is kept up to date (enable the auto-update option).

If your IT environment is large or complex, you may need to use a managed service provider (MSP) or an external IT expert. They can help to identify and block malicious activity.

If you already engage an MSP, discuss if they can also proactively log and monitor events in your IT environment.

**Helpful guidance**

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides detailed guidance and step-by-step instructions to help you select and use antivirus software:

**Why is this important?**

Cyber security threats are rapidly evolving, and sometimes despite your best efforts a security incident can still happen. Being able to quickly identify if an incident occurs, can make the difference between a big or small impact on your business. Proactively monitoring your businessâ€™ technology environment is important to detect suspicious activity.
