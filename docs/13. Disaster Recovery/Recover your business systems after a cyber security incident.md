#Action-Later 

**What you need to do**

Develop a plan for maintaining continuity of operations for the following:

- the priority of critical systems and information your business holds, whether on premises or in the cloud 
- contact details for key stakeholders internal and external to your business and their roles and responsibilities
- strategies for maintaining systems availability. Examples include, enabling employees to access alternative systems from home or an alternative work site, using backup / alternate systems.

Develop a recovery plan to restore critical systems in your business as quickly as possible for:

- systems managed by a cloud service provider – the provider may already have processes in place to help restore them promptly. It’s important to engage with them.
- on-premises systems – to detail the process to repair damage to critical business processes and systems through to the point where normal operational capabilities can be resumed.

Engage an expert to help with developing these plans if required:

- continuity and recovery plans can be complex depending on the nature of your business and how many systems you have. 
- consider if you need external help with the services of a cyber security expert.

Some businesses may merge continuity and recovery plans into a single document. For the purposes of this recommendation they have been treated as separate concepts and plans.

**Why is this important?**

While an incident response plan helps your business deal with the immediate need to limit the effects of an incident and engage with all relevant stakeholders. It's also valuable to have plans in place to identify how your business:

maintains continuity of operations when an incident occurs (Business Continuity Plan) restores key systems back to normal after an incident occurs (Disaster Recovery Plan).
