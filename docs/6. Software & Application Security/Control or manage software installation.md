**Why is this important?**

The more software or applications you have installed on your devices, the more chance there is for cyber attackers to target your business. This could be through the use of malware or exploiting vulnerabilities in installed software or applications. Some software may secretly include adware or malware which could impact your systems. For these reasons it's best to limit what's installed to what is absolutely necessary for you to do business.
