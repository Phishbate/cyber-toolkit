Scams are a common way that cybercriminals target small businesses. Their goal is to scam you or your staff into:

- sending money or gift cards
- clicking on malicious links or attachments
- giving away sensitive information, such as passwords.

Cybercriminals may try and scam your business through email, text messages, phone calls and social media. They will often pretend to be a person or organisation you trust.

#### Phishing attacks

Of particular concern to small businesses are **phishing attacks**. These scams often contain a link to a fake website where you are encouraged to log in to an account or enter confidential details.

Phishing attacks typically compromise your account passwords. Cybercriminals often use this method to “takeover” the social media accounts of small businesses and hold them to ransom.

#### Ways to mitigate

**If a message is from a known entity and seems suspicious, use caution. Contact the person or business separately to check if message is legitimate**. Use contact details you find through a legitimate source, for instance by visiting the business’s official website, and not those contained in the suspicious message.

### Case study
An employee at a courier company received an email from one of their Executive staff, asking that they purchase 6 x $500 MasterCard prepaid credit cards. The Executive told her to keep it confidential as the cards would be gift vouchers for staff members. Once purchased, the employee was asked to photograph both sides of the cards and send them through to the Executive as proof of purchase.

As instructed, the employee went to a post office and used her personal credit card to purchase the gift cards. She replied to the Executive’s email and sent through photos of the gift cards as proof.

After returning from the post office, the employee gave the physical cards to the Executive – who had no knowledge of them. On review, **all emails about the gift cards came from a random email address and were not from the Executive’s legitimate email account. It had been a scam.**
