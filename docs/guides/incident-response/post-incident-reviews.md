## Create a plan to respond to cyber security incidents
##### What you need to do

### Undertake a post incident review process

**What you need to do**

After an incident occurs, it's important to remain vigilant to confirm the incident has been fully resolved. Undertaking a post incident review with key people in your business can help with this process of confirmation. Include those who are responsible for your systems and devices, as well as any external experts you've engaged.

Consider, for example, whether there are any signs there may still be a cyber security issue:

- are systems running slowly, or are you still getting alerts from anti-virus software?  
- do your external cyber security advisers / incident response firm agree the incident is resolved?

It's important to review the how the incident was handled. This will help determine how you can improve your incident response process in the future. Document these lessons for future reference.

If you've engaged external experts for support, they can help with this process.

**Helpful guidance**

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides detailed guidance and step-by-step instructions to help you understand and implement recommended actions:

**Why is this important?**

Undertaking a review process once your business experiences a security incident can help your business in two ways. It can help you:

1. confirm the incident has indeed been fully resolved
2. identify lessons learned that can be used to improve your incident response process for the future.
