**What you need to do**
Check if the information stored on your backups is accessible and working, every 2-3 months, or so. In particular, consider:

- Is the information you want to have backed up there?
- Are the copies of the information stored on those backups accessible and fully intact? For example, do key documents open when you try to access them?
- Is the information you are backing up recent enough? If it's too old, it may be time to consider increasing the frequency of your backups.

**Why is this important?**
If your business experiences a security incident where important information is corrupted or lost, having backups you can rely on is critical. Sometimes a backup can fail if:

- it was copied over correctly  
- it becomes corrupted over time â€“ particularly where those backups occur to physical media such as an external USB drive.
