- [ ]  Ensure the Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) are configured and enabled.
- [ ]  Enable SPAM filter.
- [ ]  Ensure your email server or gateway is reviewing inbound emails for proper SPF, DKIM, compliance, and handling via DMARC records
- [ ]  Properly configure firewall/email filter. Restrict outside emails with an internal email address. Restrict any email that fails a SPF/DKIM record check.
- [ ]  Minimize user access rights. As much as possible, minimize the access rights of users to the minimum needed for them to perform their job.
- [ ]  Enable Single-Sign-On (SSO) where feasible.
- [ ]  Enable multi-factor authentication where feasible.
- [ ]  Enable web filtering. Block users from going to identified malicious sites.
- [ ]  Establish a reporting mechanism for users to report suspicious emails, such as Phishing Inbox.
- [ ]  Provide security awareness training to employees. Ensure employees are trained on social engineering tactics, including phishing. Higher risk employees should receive continued phishing simulation and training.
- [ ]  Ensure software is current and updated.
- [ ]  Maintain anti-malware software. Ensure end user devices have up-to-date malware software.
- [ ]  block known malicious emails.
- [ ]  Operationally, establish dual controls and/or out-of-band verification for key transactions, such as wire transfers.
- [ ]  Encrypt mobile devices containing non- public data. Most do, as internal emails between employees may contain non-public details.
