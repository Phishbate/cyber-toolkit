The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has provided some guidance:

**Why is this important?**

In the last few years, more and more compliance obligations have been introduced both in Australia and globally. They may impact your business’ approach to cyber security and the way you handle information, either directly or indirectly.

Other regulatory and compliance requirements may apply if you conduct business globally. Non-compliance could result in heavy fines and other penalties, as well as reputational damage.
