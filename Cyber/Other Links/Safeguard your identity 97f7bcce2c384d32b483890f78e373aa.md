## Identity theft explained

Identity theft occurs when someone gains access to your personal information without your consent, to steal money or gain other benefits.

Personal information they may seek to access includes your name, address, date of birth or bank account details.

They may then use your credit card, access your bank account, use your personal details, send emails from your email account, or use your identity to commit crimes and evade the law.

If you're a victim of identity theft, it can lead to fraud that can have a direct impact on your personal finances. This could make it difficult for you to obtain loans, credit cards or a mortgage until the matter is resolved.

## How your identity can be stolen

There are many ways for your identity to be hijacked. It happen through an email or phone call where the thief pretends to be from a charity, a bank, your service provider or even a government agency.

Thieves may also hijack Facebook accounts and email addresses to impersonate your friends and loved ones and ask for money or information. Or they may send you an email with an attached virus that captures your password and personal information.

It can also happen on a very personal level when someone gains access to the information in your wallet, your mail or from your personal documents such as a birth certificate.

## How you can protect yourself from identity theft

Beware of unsolicited phone calls or emails that ask for personal information. And always be cautious about who you provide your personal information to.

If someone is requesting your personal information ask yourself, is there a legitimate reason for me to give out this information?

There are some other simple things that you can do to help safeguard your identity.

- Make sure you have a secure place to store your personal documents.
- Destroy excess personal information kept physically.
- Do not just throw personal information away, shred it first.
- Regularly review your bank statements to check for anything unusual. Report suspicious transactions immediately.
- When using an ATM cover your PIN and check the machine to see if there is anything strange or other not quite right fixtures attached to it.

## How you can stay secure online

Here are some helpful tips to ensure you are secure online:

- Install anti-virus software on all devices where possible and ensure that routine scans are scheduled.
- Avoid using public access computers in internet cafes for internet banking.
- Use only trusted payment systems and secured websites.
- Be wary of strange emails offering deals that seem too good to be true or threaten a sense of urgency to comply with a demand. Even if the email appears to be coming from someone you trust, if it seems suspicious, treat it as suspicious.
- Never provide personal information to anyone who emails or calls you.
- Create long (minimum 14 character) and unique passwords and store them in a password manager. If you suspect that your details have been caught up in a data breach, this is when password resets should be enacted.
- Be careful about what you provide on social media and in emails;
- Delete excess personal information kept online.
- Enable 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) on all online accounts that support it.
- Enable Full Disk Encryption (FDE) on personal computers.
- Make sure that software updates are regularly installed for all of your devices.
