Here is an example of a real phishing e-mail with a few obvious indicators:

### Stop. Think. Act.

[]([https://suncorpgroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Security/SitePages/Email-Safety.aspx#stop.-think.-act.)](https://suncorpgroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Security/SitePages/Email-Safety.aspx#%E2%80%8Bstop.-think.-act.))

When you receive an e-mail, always follow these steps to ensure you are protecting yourself as well as Suncorp.

**1. Stop**

**2. Think**

Does the e-mail contain an attachment?

(Example 1)

This e-mail contains a vague, unexpected and suspicious attachment.  Unexpected attachments should **NEVER** be opened.

Do you know the sender? (Example 2)

Remember, a sender can be impersonated.  The sender of this e-mail does not match the content or context of this e-mail.

Are you expecting to receive this particular e-mail at this particular time? (Example 3)

This seems to be an odd time of day to receive an e-mail.

Does the e-mail attempt to get you to take urgent action to avoid a consequence? (Example 4)

This e-mail uses threatening vocabulary on multiple occasions to try to coerce you to take urgent action.

Does the e-mail contain poor spelling or grammar? (Example 5)

If this were an official e-mail, it would be odd for this to contain such blatant grammatical errors.

Does the e-mail ask you to click a link or open an attachment? (Example 6)

This e-mail prompts you to click/open something "important" which they claim requires urgent attention or else something negative will happen.

**3. Act**

1. You should be highly sceptical as to the authenticity of an e-mail if it contains even one or two of these key indicators.
2. If you are within the workplace and you receive a suspicious e-mail, please report them immediately using the **[Phish Alert Button](https://clicktime.symantec.com/15uBY2RPwZPeFG52SvFpc?h=2SfdUHM4mR_D2T3u0zck6UXER6j6cGl3y48bV3d7QgM=&u=http://suncorpgroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Security/SitePages/Phish-Alert-Button%281%29.aspx)** available on your Outlook ribbon or forward the email to **[security@suncorp.com.au](mailto:security@suncorp.com.au)**. By sending through suspicious e-mails, you help ensure that Suncorp and your colleagues are protected.
3. If the e-mail is important enough for you to want to validate its authenticity, do not rely upon the contact details provided within the e-mail.  Research the contact details for the organisation yourself.
4. If the e-mail asks you to log in to a website you regularly use (e.g. internet banking, Facebook, etc.), **DO NOT** use the links provided within the e-mail.  Connect to your regular websites in the same way you normally do (e.g. favourites, bookmarks, manually entering the address) and ignore the link provided in the e-mail.
5. If you are at home and you feel you have been a victim of cybercrime, report it to the [Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN)](https://report.acorn.gov.au/) or [Consumer Protection](https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/get-guidance/scamwatch/) in New Zealand.
6. Check out the [ACCC’s Little Black Book of Scams](https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/the-little-black-book-of-scams) or [Scamwatch](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/) to stay up-to-date on scams.
