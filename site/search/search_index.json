After the username and password for a login is entered, two-factor will require a unique code from a third-party app or contact to confirm that the login is valid.</p> <p>This way, a cyber criminal would require both your username, password and access to your two-factor system in order to successfully compromise a system.</p> <p>A common example of two-factor is when your bank sends through an SMS code to confirm an online purchase or exchange.

The multiple layers of authentication increase confidence that the user requesting access is who they claim to be i.e., you.</p> <p>WHERE DO I TURN IT ON?</p> <p>Where to turn on 2FA within a program depends on each program. However, the steps are universally simple and somewhat similar.

Two-step verification requires you to enter a six digit Pin before gaining access to your account. Once MFA is set up, WhatsApp will periodically ask you to enter your Pin.</p> <ol> <li> <p>In WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business, select the Settings icon in the bottom right-hand corner. If you use an Android device, you may have to access Settings by tapping three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Two-Step Verification.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Enable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enter a six-digit Pin, You will then be asked to confirm your Pin.

You can return to this page in the future if you need to change your Pin or recovery email address.</p> </li> </ol> <p>WhatsApp Security codes to verify Contacts</p> <p>Security codes are used to verify the identity of a contact and the security of one-to-one messages and calls.</p> <p>They verify messages and calls are secure and that no one is intercepting or altering your communications. This is done by scanning the QR code on your contact\u2019s device or verifying the 60-digit safety number exactly matches on both devices.</p> <p>Security codes usually, but not always, change when a contact reinstalls the app, changes phone numbers or changes devices. Users should verify with the contact as to why the safety number has changed. Users should also be on the lookout for frequent or unexpected changes as this is a sign something may be wrong.</p> <p>The following guide has been broken up into two sections. The first section shows how to enable notifications for when a security code changes. The second section shows how to verify the security code of your contact to ensure you are messaging the correct person. The contact will remain verified until the security code changes.</p> <p>HOW TO ENABLE NOTIFICATIONS WHEN A SECURITY CODE CHANGES</p> <ol> <li> <p>In WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business, select the Settings icon in the bottom right-hand corner. If you use an Android device, you may have to access Settings by tapping three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Turn on Show Security Notifications.</p> </li> </ol> <p>HOW TO VERIFY WHATSAPP SECURITY CODES</p> <ol> <li> <p>To verify the security code of a contact, select Chats and select the one-to-one conversation you wish to verify.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select the name/number of the contact.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Encryption.</p> </li> <li> <p>To check the security code, either scan the QR code on the other person\u2019s device or verify the 60-digit number matches on their device. You can send the number to them using the share button.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Only share the security code using trusted methods of communication, where you have verified that the other person is who they say they are (such as a phone call where you recognise the person\u2019s voice).</p> <p>Be wary of communication methods that could be intercepted or compromised, such as email. Consider splitting parts of the code across multiple communication methods to stay secure and don\u2019t use a WhatsApp message to the contact you are verifying as a method of verification.</p> <p>Once all steps are completed, you will have verified the contact and will be notified if their security code changes.</p> <p>Turn on MFA for your Microsoft Account</p> <p>These steps will show you how to turn on MFA for your Microsoft Account.</p> <p>After you turn on MFA, you\u2019ll need both your password and an additional authentication method to log in to your Microsoft account. This could be a security code from an authenticator app, SMS, or phone call. Alternatively, you could get a notification to the Microsoft authenticator app on your smartphone.</p> <p>MFA makes it harder for cybercriminals to access your account and it could also alert you to any suspicious activity. This means if your password is guessed or stolen and a cybercriminal is trying to login to your account, you will be sent a security code or notification. This will prevent them from logging in to your account as they won\u2019t have the security code, or you can deny them entry if you use the Microsoft authenticator app. You can then change your password to secure your account.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have MFA turned on, you may not get notifications on attempts to log in to your account.</p> <p>This guide will show you how to set up MFA for your Microsoft Account on your computer. If you don\u2019t have access to a computer, you can follow these steps on any device, however some screens may appear different than pictured.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open an internet browser (for example Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox or Opera).

Never approve unknown sign in attempts or give anyone else your MFA code.</p> <p>TRANSFER YOUR AUTHENTICATOR WHEN CHANGING DEVICES</p> <p>If you are using an authenticator app for MFA and you get a new device, make sure you transfer it to your new device before disposing of or resetting the old one. We recommend adding a recovery method to your account and saving your backup codes in case you lose access to your authenticator app.</p> <p>KEEP YOUR APPS UP TO DATE</p> <p>For security reasons it is important to keep your apps up to date. Wherever you are logged into your account, make sure the apps are up to date, whether it be an internet browser, Microsoft Office, email or other apps on your phone. Updates often include important security upgrades.</p> <p>KEEP YOUR OS UP TO DATE</p> <p>It is also important to keep your operating system up to date. Updates will have important security upgrades. Ensure that all computers and phones have the most recent version of software and if a device is no longer supported by software updates or security updates, consider replacing it.</p> <p>CHECK YOUR RECENT ACTIVITY</p> <p>If you receive an email notifying you of unusual activity, you can see when and where your account has been accessed\u2014including successful sign-ins and security challenges\u2014 on the Recent activity page.

Just as we do not use a single key to open our house, car and office, we have different passwords for our many online sites and resources.  </p> <p>It is also important that each of these keys (or passwords) is unique and strong to prevent unauthorised access, costly identity theft and fraud. This means that we often end up with a bunch of passwords that we struggle to remember for future access.</p> <p>How do we create and safely keep track of these strong and unique passwords? This is where a password manager comes in! A password manager is software that safely archives all your passwords for your websites and digital resources. The password manager then encrypts (or secretly encodes) your passwords within a secure vault.</p> <p>You would then create a strong and unique master password which you regularly update. This master password then allows you to automatically access all of your websites and other online resources, meaning that you only have one strong password to remember as opposed to a collection of them.</p> <p>This not only removes the pressure of\u00a0remembering &amp; safely storing\u00a0all of your passwords, but also enables you to create much stronger passwords that are automatically &amp; securely stored in the manager.</p> <p>You can even have the password manager automatically generate random and secure passwords rather than creating them yourself.</p> <p>How do you use a password manager? You first visit your selected website and navigate to the login page. Instead of typing in your password for the website, you type your master password into the password manager browser extension. The password manager then fills in your correct login credentials for the website, logging you in automatically.</p> <p>Here are some benefits that you can expect to enjoy from your password manager:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Convenience: You only need to remember a single master password. You can easily login to your accounts, as your master password enables the autofill logins for each site.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security: Not only are your passwords stored securely, your password manager can also generate random passwords for each of your accounts. Some password managers also allow you to reset your passwords and even change them periodically.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flexibility: We all use a range of devices to access the same cyber resources.

This manager gives you the option of storing your passwords using the cloud or locally on one device. LastPass securely encrypts and stores your passwords, making it easy for you to audit your passwords (or check to see if your passwords are easily hacked), generate strong, unique passwords, and automatically reset any passwords that may have been used in a compromised setting. Lastpass also provides password support on your mobile devices. This password manager utilizes a two-factor (two-step) authentication process which ensures that your password vault is accessible only to you.</p> <p>Dashlane This is a fairly new password manager, but it has support apps for most operating systems and platforms. It offers the two-factor authentication, as well as the option to share passwords with emergency contacts in the event of that you can't access your accounts. This password manager informs you if you have accounts on compromised websites. It also facilitates the automatic change of multiple passwords with a few clicks.</p> <p>KeePass KeePass stores your passwords in an encrypted database that you manage on your own system.

You can use password managers on computers and mobile devices.</p> <p>Password Manager Tips.</p> <p>TIP #1 - MAKE YOUR MASTER PASSWORD YOUR STRONGEST.</p> <p>Your master password is the key to your safe. If someone guesses your master password, they may be able to access all your passwords. Make sure your master password is unique and your strongest password.</p> <p>The strongest type of password is a passphrase which is easy to remember. Passphrases are a combination of random words, for example, \u2018crystal onion clay pretzel\u2019. The best passphrases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0are at least 14 characters long</p> </li> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0use a random mix of four or more words</p> </li> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0do not use popular phrases, for example, song lyrics or famous</p> <p>quotes</p> </li> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0are not reused across multiple accounts</p> <p>Passphrases are easy for you to remember and hard for machines to crack.</p> </li> </ul> <p>TIP #2 - ENABLE MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION.</p> <p>Multi-factor authentication is a method of increasing the security of a password manager.</p> <p>Multi-factor authentication requires you to prove your identity in two or more ways before you can access sensitive features of your password manager. It typically requires a combination of at least two of:</p> <ul> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0something you know (e.g. a passphrase or PIN)</p> </li> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0something you have (e.g. an authenticator app or physical token) or</p> </li> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0something you are (e.g. your fingerprint or face scan).</p> <p>Enabling multi-factor authentication on your password manager adds an additional layer of security.</p> <p>It means that even if a cybercriminal learns your master password, they will not be able to access your other passwords as your other authentication methods keep your password manager secure.</p> <p>TIP #3 - CHOOSE THE RIGHT PASSWORD MANAGER FOR YOU.</p> <p>When choosing a password manager, do your research to ensure that the vendor has a good reputation and that their product has strong security and privacy features as well as maintained with regular security updates.</p> <p>Different password managers have different features. Consider what features are important to you. You may want to check if your password manager:</p> </li> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0has a plan that covers family members</p> </li> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0can manage your passwords across multiple devices</p> </li> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0supports all the different devices you use</p> </li> <li> <p>\u25cf \u00a0ensures only you can see your saved passwords, even the company</p> <p>that makes the password manager cannot see them.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Many password managers are free, and some are included with certain devices and programs.

However, many common Cyber Security Terms are both super-helpful and easy to understand once they're explained in plain English.</p> <p>Read ahead for more information on common Cyber Security Terms.</p> <p>Anti-virus Software Anti-virus software (or anti-malware program) refers to programs &amp; software that are used to locate, stop, and destroy malicious software (malware). Malware can include phishing attacks, ransomware, trojans, and other general viruses targetting your systems.</p> <p>In addition to using anti-virus software, we recommend that you combine other lines of defense such as an encryption programme and a strong firewall to ensure that you're well-protected.</p> <p>Cyber Attack A cyber-attack is any category of offensive action used by cyber criminals to either deposit malicious code into your computer system, gain unwarranted access to your system(s), or fraudulently attain your data.</p> <p>The intent of such actions commonly includes theft, the modification and/or destruction of data, and the manipulation of your systems, devices, and/or virtual identity in coordinated attacks against others.</p> <p>Drive-by Download A drive-by download can be either:</p> <p>A download that you have authorised without fully understanding the consequences.</p> <p>An unintended download of a virus or other malicious software (malware) onto your device.</p> <p>A drive-by download can occur when you visit a website, when you click on links in an infected email, or when you click on pop-up windows. It's important to stay aware of what we are downloading, as well as keeping your operating system/anti-virus software up-to-date to guard against malware through drive-by downloads.</p> <p>Exploit An exploit is software, data, or commands which take advantage of vulnerabilities in your system. Exploits cause unusual behaviour in your computer software and hardware. Once again, it is recommended that you keep your operating system and its defenses current to protect against exploits.</p> <p>Keylogging Keylogging (or keystroke logging) occurs when online criminals secretly record (or log) the keys that you touch on your keyboard in order to obtain your private information. We recommend that you install anti-spyware software to detect and disable such malware.</p> <p>Malvertising Malvertising (or malicious advertising) is the misuse of electronic advertising to distribute malware. These online culprits insert malware code into advertising networks or legitimate websites, which then infect your computer systems whenever you interact with these sources.</p> <p>Malware Malware (malicious software) is software that is used by cyber criminals to do the following without your knowledge:</p> <p>Illegally access your private computer systems,</p> <p>Disrupt the operation of your computer systems,</p> <p>Collect confidential data.</p> <p>Some examples of malware are ransomware, spyware, Trojans and viruses. Malware is generally distributed through code, scripts, and active content embedded in legitimate sources such as documents and websites.</p> <p>Patching Patching occurs when you update software to a more recent version. A patch is a minor update released by the manufacturer to address vulnerabilities in the existing software. We recommend that you allow your software to automatically update to keep your system free of glitches.</p> <p>Phishing Phishing is one method online criminals use to obtain private information (login credentials, payment card info, etc.) by impersonating a legitimate entity (such as your bank) in emails or through other virtual communication media. Phishing can also be considered as social engineering, as it entails the use of deception to harm victims.</p> <p>Ransomware Ransomware is a form of malware that cyber criminals use to encrypt your files (or lock you out of your system), and then they request an untraceable ransom payment before releasing your files to you (or restoring your access). We ask that you regularly backup your files to a remote server.</p> <p>Social engineering Social engineering is a common technique used by cyber criminals to hack a system. It focuses on psychological manipulation to lead victims to perform certain harmful actions or to disclose sensitive information.</p> <p>Spam In short; spam is unsolicited emails and other electronic communications. Spam may seem benign, but they often contain malware that is used to execute severe cyber attacks. Always treat emails and other communications cautiously, in consideration that they could be spam.</p> <p>Trojan (Trojan horse) A Trojan horse (or Trojan) is a form of malware that disguises itself as a normal file or programme designed to trick you into installing that malware into your system. A Trojan can be very harmful as it allows cyber criminals to:</p> <p>Replicate the malware,</p> <p>Steal your personal data,</p> <p>Monitor your virtual/online activity,</p> <p>Use your computer in a coordinated attack against other targets,</p> <p>Hold your files and/or computer system ransom,</p> <p>Crash your computer,</p> <p>Format your disks and/or destroy all your computer files.</p> <p>Zero-Day Virus Zero-Day viruses occur when online criminals find an area of vulnerability in a piece of software that doesn't require human participation to exploit. They then take advantage of the glitch and attack users and systems unexpectedly. These attacks cannot be easily rebuffed as these Zero-Day Viruses are often completely new, leaving anti-virus programmes ill-equipped to immediately address them.</p>"},{"location":"Playbook/Data%20Management/Handle%20sensitive%20client%2C%20business%20and%20staff%20information%20securely/","title":"Handle sensitive client, business and staff information securely","text":"<p>What you need to do</p> <p>Understand exactly what types of important information you have in your business and where it is located.

Firstly, you need to understand which measures you need to action. Key measures to secure portable devices include:</p> <ul> <li>Encryption \u2013 enable device encryption if you're storing or accessing important business information on portable devices. This ensures the information can't be accessed by someone else without your permission, even if you lose it.</li> <li>Updates \u2013 use the automatic update feature to install application and operating system updates on portable devices as soon as they're available. Apps should only be installed from official device application stores.</li> <li>Unlocking \u2013 enforce the use of a strong password, PIN, gesture or fingerprint to unlock portable devices. Ensure devices are set to automatically lock when not in use. Information could be compromised on devices that are not locked, if those devices are lost.</li> <li>Remote locking \u2013 enable remote locking and/or wiping functions (if supported). If a portable device is lost these functions can help reduce the risk of information being compromised.</li> <li>Security software \u2013 install reputable security software that includes antivirus and anti-theft/loss protection. Your device's retailer or service provider can provide recommendations.</li> <li>Passwords \u2013 set the device to require a password before anyone tries to install applications. This will prevent unauthorised modifications to the device.</li> </ul> <p>Secondly, it's important to consider what actions you can take to put into place security measures on all your portable devices. What will be practical from a time, efficiency and cost perspective will depend on your business. Some options are outlined below:</p> <ul> <li>Educate staff \u2013 educate your staff about how to securely configure their portable devices and then ask them to do it themselves. The downside of this approach is that there is no guarantee your staff will configure devices correctly.</li> <li>Manual device security \u2013 you may wish to set up device security before providing them to staff. You can either do this yourself or engage the services of an external IT expert. The advantage of this approach is the confidence devices are set up securely before staff start to use them.</li> <li>Central tool \u2013 a centralised tool may be a more practical way of enforcing secure configuration settings.
