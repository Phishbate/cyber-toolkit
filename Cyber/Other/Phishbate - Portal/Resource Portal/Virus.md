A cyber virus is a type of malicious software that replicates itself and spreads to other computers or devices. Cyber viruses can cause significant damage to individual users and organizations. Here are some of the most common types of cyber viruses:

## 1. Computer Worms

Computer worms are self-replicating programs that spread through computer networks. They can cause significant damage to networks by consuming bandwidth and system resources. Some worms can steal sensitive information and compromise security.

## 2. Trojan Horses

Trojan horses are malicious programs disguised as legitimate software. They can be used to steal personal information, such as passwords and banking details, or to install other malware on the victim's computer.

## 3. Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware attacks can be devastating for individuals and organizations, as they can result in the loss of important data and financial losses.

## 4. Spyware

Spyware is a type of malware that is designed to secretly monitor a victim's computer activity. It can be used to steal sensitive information, such as passwords and banking details, and to track a victim's online behavior.

## 5. Adware

Adware is a type of malware that displays unwanted advertisements on a victim's computer. It can slow down the computer and compromise security by exposing the victim to other types of malware.

It is important to protect your computer and devices from cyber viruses by installing antivirus software, keeping your software up to date, and being cautious when downloading files or clicking on links.
