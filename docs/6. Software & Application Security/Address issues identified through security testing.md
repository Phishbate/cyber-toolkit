#Action-Later

**What you need to do**

Understand who you can engage to help you understand and remediate security issues identified during security testing. These could include:

- Your managed services provider (MSP)  
- Your internal IT person â€“ if they have the expertise  
- An external expert. If you engaged them to provide testing, ask them to go through the key issues identified in the testing report Other service providers. If your website is managed externally, the company hosting it may be able to help, so ask them

**Develop a remediation plan**

Once security testing has been completed you will generally be provided with a report outlining:

- security issues that exist in your systems / website  
- general guidance on remediation actions that need to be taken.

Develop a plan to ensure these actions are taken and regularly review it to track progress. The plan should cover:

- Security issues that need to be fixed  
- Who in your business (or externally) is responsible for fixing the issue
- Expected timeframes for completion. It's wise to focus on extreme and high risk issues first followed by moderate and low. If you work with a security expert for testing, they should be able to provide you this guidance.

**Helpful guidance**

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides detailed guidance and step-by-step instructions to help you understand and implement recommended actions:

**Why is this important?**

It's very important to take steps to address security issues in your IT environment once you become aware of them. This is vital if they present a very high risk of a cyber security breach to your business.
