##### What you need to do

A plan to respond to security incidents does not need to be extensive. You still need to have one, even if it’s just a basic plan. Include the following in this plan:

1. Contact details of external people and organisations your business may need to engage if you experience a security incident. It's important to have these details on hand during an incident. Include phone numbers and email addresses where appropriate
2. Details of who is responsible for managing the response process, including making and/or signing off on decisions
3. Possible signs of an incident, which could include:
    - devices running slower than usual or restarting unexpectedly
    - unexpected pop-ups appearing continuously
    - alerts from anti-malware software
    - unexpected configuration changes to devices
    - unfamiliar files
    - unexpected changes to your website
4. A sequence of steps to follow if there are concerns an incident has occurred:
    - Who to contact for support and advice – IT support, legal and cyber security advisers, and/or law enforcement
    - Basic steps to take while seeking advice – isolating affected devices from use until an expert can review the issue
5. Undertaking a review process once the incident is resolved. This can help you identify lessons learned to improve your incident response process for the future.

Once you develop the plan, make sure it is easily accessible and you share it with your staff.

##### Why is this important?

It's important to take steps to protect your business as much as possible from a cyber security incident. The reality is that there will always be some risk that your business does experience one. The way you respond can be the difference between your business experiencing a minor disruption or suffering major damage.

Having a plan prepared in advance is crucial. It will help your business understand what needs to be done if there is an incident. Trying to handle an incident without a plan is not wise. You'll be under great pressure which will make decisions without clear direction, very challenging.

If your business handles security incidents effectively, it can also enhance your relationships with external stakeholders (customers and partners).
