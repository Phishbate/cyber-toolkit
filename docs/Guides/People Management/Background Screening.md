# Conduct background screenings when hiring new staff


**What you need to do**

Establish a background check process for new starters, to include:

- An identity check – using a recognised form of identification, such as an Australian state or territory driver's licence or Australian passport.
- Police record check – these are obtainable through state and territory police forces. Employment history – to check referees and previous places of employment.

You can also engage a company who specialises in doing background checks.

**Include a dispute process**

This will allow your staff and potential new hires to identify incorrect information from these checks.

**Helpful guidance**

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides detailed guidance about personnel security in the guide:

- **Malicious insiders** [https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats/type-threats/system-and-network-attacks/malicious-insiders]

**Why is this important?**

In some cases, cyber incidents can to occur because of the acts of malicious insiders within a business. Malicious insiders can be employees, former employees, contractors or business associates. They may have legitimate access to your systems and data, but use that access to destroy data, steal data or sabotage your systems. It does not include well-meaning staff who accidentally put your cyber security at risk. Conducting pre-employment background checks can be a good first step in limiting the potential for someone with malicious intent to join your business. This is especially the case if that person is likely to have access to sensitive systems or information.
