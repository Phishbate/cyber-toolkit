#Action-Later 

**What you needto do**

Testing an incident response plan, at least annually, can include:

- **Tabletop exercises** – key stakeholders in your business gather in a room and run through a mock security incident. You apply the documented incident response plan and work through the issues you would face during an incident. It enables everyone to familiarise themselves with the response process from start to finish, who they need to interact with (internally and externally) and identifies potential deficiencies that need addressing. A facilitator leads the exercise, taking you through various scenarios and discussing which steps to take. An external cyber security expert can help run these exercises if you need it.
- **Technical simulations** – it can be useful to simulate a real-world attack against your business by engaging a third party consultant. It pressure tests your incident response processes more effectively than any form of paper-based exercise. This isn't practical or viable for every business.

**Why is this important?**

While it’s important to have a security incident response plan, you need to test it on a regular basis. You should test it at least annually. This is vital to:

- determine how the plan will actually work if an incident occurs 
- identify any weaknesses or failings that need to be addressed.
