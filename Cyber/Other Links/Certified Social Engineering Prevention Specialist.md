**Certified Social Engineering Prevention Specialist** (**CSEPS**) refers to both an individual [Mitnick Security Consulting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitnick_Security_Consulting) certification and a broader [professional certification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification) program.

The CSEPS program currently offers one type of certification. To attain this certification, a candidate must attend a CSEPS training course and pass the exam proctored at completion.

The training program focuses primarily on how [Social Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)) works through the use of numerous case histories and a detailed breakdown of the [psychological principles related to influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). It more specifically focuses on how a malicious hacker or information thief uses Social Engineering and/or [Pretexting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretexting) to obtain illicit access to [computer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_systems) by duping employees, and what can be done to minimize social engineering based attacks in an organization.

The course and exam costs approximately [US$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_dollar)2300.00 per person. The course is two days in length. The exams takes between 1 and 2 hours to complete and consists of between 50-90 multiple choice questions and an essay section dealing with specific actions taken to prevent Social Engineering in a proposed scenario.

The exam was first designed by [Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick) and [Alexis Kasperaviƒçius](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexis_Kasperavi%C4%8Dius&action=edit&redlink=1) in 2004, with assistance from various experts in the psychology field.
