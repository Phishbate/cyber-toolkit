The offence comprises three elements. The offence is committed if: a person causes any unauthorised access to, or modification of, restricted data; the person intends to cause the access or modification; and the person knows that the access or modification is unauthorised. The maximum penalty for a contravention of s. 478.1 of the Code is two years\u2019 imprisonment. For the purposes of this offence, \u201crestricted data\u201d means data held in a computer to which access is restricted by an access control system.</p> <p>An example of state-based legislation criminalising hacking of private computer systems is Part 6 the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900 (\u201cNSW Crimes Act\u201d). Part 6 relates to \u201cComputer Offences\u201d and sets out multiple offences centred around unauthorised access, modification, or impairment of restricted data and electronic communications.</p> <p>Denial-of-service attacks</p> <p>Denial-of-Service attacks (\u201cDoS attacks\u201d) or Distributed Denial- of-Service attacks (\u201cDDoS attacks\u201d) are criminalised by s. 477.3 of the Code, which provides for the offence of \u201cUnauthorised impairment of electronic communication\u201d.</p> <p>The offence comprises two elements and is committed if: a person causes any unauthorised impairment of electronic communication to or from a computer; and the person knows that the impairment is unauthorised. The maximum penalty for a contravention of s. 477.3 of the Code is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>Phishing</p> <p>Phishing, being a form of online fraud, is criminalised under the Code in instances where the victim is said to be a Commonwealth entity. When the victim is a member of the public, charges are brought under parallel State or Territory legislation. In New South Wales (\u201cNSW\u201d), charges could be brought under s. 192E of the NSW Crimes Act, which criminalises the general offence of fraud.</p> <p>Prosecutions for Commonwealth fraud could encompass a wide variety of offending conduct, including phishing-style offences that would affect a Federal government body. Depending on the subsequent financial gain or loss suffered subsequent to the activity, the below charges are available:</p> <ul> <li>S. 134.2(1) \u2013 obtaining a financial advantage by deception.</li> <li>S. 135.1(1) \u2013 general dishonesty \u2013 obtaining a gain.</li> <li>S. 135.1(3) \u2013 general dishonesty \u2013 causing a loss.</li> <li>S. 135.1(5) \u2013 general dishonesty \u2013 causing a loss to another.</li> </ul> <p>For the charge to be proven, the prosecution must establish that the accused obtains or causes a financial advantage, gain or loss by way of deception or dishonesty. The maximum penalty for each offence is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>Infection of IT systems with malware (including ransomware, spyware, worms, trojans and viruses)</p> <p>The infection of IT systems with malware is criminalised by s. 478.2 of the Code, which provides for the offence of \u201cunauthorised impairment of data held on a computer disk etc.\u201d.</p> <p>The offence comprises three elements and is committed if: a person causes any unauthorised impairment of the reliability, security or operation of data held on a computer disk, a credit card or another device used to store data by electronic means; the person intends to cause the impairment; and the person knows that the impairment is unauthorised. The maximum penalty is two years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>As an example of state-based offences of this nature, conduct of this type would likely be encompassed within the \u201cmodification or impairment\u201d aspects of the NSW Crimes Act Part 6 Computer Offences.</p> <p>Distribution, sale or offering for sale of hardware, software or other tools used to commit cybercrime</p> <p>Distribution, sale or offering for sale of hardware, software or other tools used to commit cybercrime is criminalised by s. 478.4 of the Code, which provides for the offence of producing, supplying or obtaining data with intent to commit a computer offence. The offence comprises two elements.</p> <p>The offence is committed if: a person produces, supplies or obtains data; and the person does so with the intention that the data be used, by the person or another person, in committing an offence against Division 477 of the Code or facilitating the commission of such an offence. The maximum penalty for a contravention of s. 478.4 of the Code is three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>Possession or use of hardware, software or other tools used to commit cybercrime</p> <p>Possession or use of hardware, software or other tools used to commit cybercrime is criminalised by s. 478.3 of the Code, which provides for the offence of possession or control of data with intent to commit a computer offence.</p> <p>The offence comprises two elements. The offence is committed if: a person has possession or control of data; and the person has that possession or control with the intention that the data be used, by the person or another person, in committing an offence against Division 477 of the Code or facilitating the commission of such an offence. The maximum penalty for a contravention of s. 478.3 of the Code is three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>An example of a state equivalent can be found in ss 308F and 308G of the NSW Crimes Act.</p> <p>Identity theft or identity fraud (e.g. in connection with access devices)</p> <p>Identity crime, and in particular identity fraud offences, are criminalised by Division 372 of the Code. Particular acts that are criminalised include dealing in identification information, dealing in identification information that involves use of a carriage service, possession of identification information, and possession of equipment used to make identification information.</p> <p>The offence of \u201cDealing in identification information that involves use of a carriage service\u201d is most relevant to cybercrime. It is criminalised by s. 372.1A of the Code and comprises four elements. The offence is committed if: a person deals in identification information; the person does so using a carriage service; the person intends that any person will use the identification information to pretend to be, or to pass the user off as, another person (whether living, dead, real or fictitious) for the purpose of committing an offence or facilitating the commission of an offence; and the offence is an indictable offence against the law of the Commonwealth, an indictable offence against a law of a State or Territory or a foreign indictable offence. The maximum penalty is five years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p>Electronic theft (e.g. breach of confidence by a current or former employee, or criminal copyright infringement)</p> <p>Electronic theft is criminalised by s. 478.1 of the Code. This offence is committed if a person modifies restricted data. Modification is defined in the Code as the alteration or removal of the data held in a computer, or an addition to the data held in a computer. As such, the unauthorised copying of data from a computer would contravene this offence provision.</p> <p>Unsolicited penetration testing (i.e. the exploitation of an IT system without the permission of its owner to determine its vulnerabilities and weak points)</p> <p>Penetration testing activity without authority could offend the above-mentioned s. 478.1 of the Code, which provides for the offence of \u201cUnauthorised access to, or modification of, restricted data\u201d.</p> <p>Any other activity that adversely affects or threatens the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of any IT system, infrastructure, communications network, device or data</p> <p>Part 10.6 of the Code creates offences related to telecommunication services. They include offences relating to dishonesty with respect to carriage services and interference with telecommunications.</p> <p>Additionally, the above-mentioned Part 6 of the NSW Crimes Act would likely be an example of state legislation that could cover these types of activities.</p> <p>1.2 Do any of the above-mentioned offences have extraterritorial application?</p> <p>Extended geographical jurisdiction applies to offences under Part 10.7 of the Code (Divisions 477 and 478).</p> <p>A person will not commit offences under that Part unless: the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs wholly or partly in Australia, or wholly or partly on-board an Australian aircraft or an Australian ship; the conduct constituting the alleged offences occurs wholly outside Australia and a result of the conduct occurs wholly or partly in Australia, or wholly or partly on-board an Australian aircraft or an Australian ship; the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs wholly outside Australia; and, at the time of the alleged offence, the person is an Australian citizen or at the time of the alleged offence, the person is a body corporate incorporated by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or all of the following conditions are satisfied: the alleged offence is an ancillary offence; the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs wholly outside Australia; and the conduct constituting the primary offence to which the ancillary offence relates, or a result of that conduct, occurs, or is intended by the person to occur, wholly or partly in Australia or wholly or partly on-board an Australian aircraft or an Australian ship.</p> <p>1.3 Are there any factors that might mitigate any penalty or otherwise constitute an exception to any of the above-mentioned offences (e.g. where the offence involves \u201cethical hacking\u201d, with no intent to cause damage or make a financial gain)?</p> <p>Section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) sets out matters for the Court to consider when passing sentences for federal offences, including offences against the Code. Matters that will generally mitigate a penalty include the timing of any guilty plea, the offender\u2019s character, the offender\u2019s prior record, assistance provided by the offender to the authorities and the offender\u2019s prospect of rehabilitation and likelihood of reoffending. In some circumstances, the absence of intent to cause damage or make a financial gain could be taken into account by a sentencing court as a factor of mitigation, if this is not a necessary element of the offence.</p> <p>A number of the offences particularised above require intent to be proven to establish the charge. For example, a necessary element of s. 478.2 of the Code is that the defendant \u201cintended to cause the impairment\u201d to the data. It is feasible that a factual scenario could exist where impairment to the data is caused without the necessary intent to cause that impairment or damage. This means the offence would not be established.</p> <p>Furthermore, a number of the offences particularised above cannot be \u201cattempted\u201d; they must actually be committed. For example, a person cannot attempt to commit the offence of \u201cUnauthorised access, modification or impairment with intent to commit a serious offence\u201d.</p>"},{"location":"TBS/Policy%20Toolkit/Cybersecurity%20Laws%20and%20Regulations%20Report%202023%20Aus/#2-cybersecurity-laws","title":"2.

This may include, for example, data protection and e-privacy laws, intellectual property laws, confidentiality laws, information security laws, and import/export controls, among others.</p> <p>The following laws in Australia relate to cybersecurity: the Privacy Act (Cth) (\u201cPrivacy Act\u201d); the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth); the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth); the Code (Cth); and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth).</p> <p>2.2 Critical or essential infrastructure and services: Are there any cybersecurity requirements under Applicable Laws (in addition to those outlined above) applicable specifically to critical infrastructure, operators of essential services, or similar, in your jurisdiction?</p> <p>The Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth), which commenced on 11 July 2018, seeks to manage national security risks of sabotage, espionage and coercion posed by foreign entities. The Act was implemented as a response to technological changes that have increased cyber connectivity to critical infrastructure. An object of the Act, set out at s. 3(d), includes \u201cimposing enhanced cybersecurity obligations on relevant entities for systems of national significance in order to improve their preparedness for, and ability to respond to, cybersecurity incidents\u201d.</p> <p>The Australian Government considers \u201cthe responsibility for ensuring the continuity of operations and the provision of essential services to the Australian economy and community\u201d as being shared \u201cbetween owners and operators of critical infrastructure, state and territory governments and the Australian Government\u201d.</p> <p>In April 2022, the Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure Protection) Act 2022 came into effect. This Act expanded the application of the 2018 Act from electricity, gas, water and ports, to also include defence, space, transport, food and grocery, higher education and research, healthcare and medical services, energy, financial services and markets, data storage or processing, water and sewerage, and communication sectors as critical infrastructure sectors.</p> <p>Under s. 30BC of the Act, if an entity responsible for a critical infrastructure asset becomes aware that a cybersecurity incident has occurred or is occurring, and the incident has had, or is having, a significant impact on the availability of the asset, the entity must report it to the relevant Commonwealth body as soon as practicable, and in any event within 12 hours after the entity becomes aware.</p> <p>Under s. 30BD of the Act, if an entity responsible for a critical infrastructure asset becomes aware that a cybersecurity incident has occurred, is occurring or is imminent, and the incident has had, is having, or is likely to have, a relevant impact on the asset, the entity must report it to the relevant Commonwealth body as soon as practicable, and in any event within 72 hours after the entity becomes aware.</p> <p>The relevant Commonwealth body is the Australian Cyber Security Centre (\u201cACSC\u201d).</p> <p>Under s. 30CD of the Act, an entity responsible for a system of national significance must adopt and maintain an incident response plan for cybersecurity incidents.</p> <p>Under s. 30CM of the Act, an entity responsible for a system of national significance may be required to undertake a cybersecurity exercise, to test the entity\u2019s ability and preparedness to appropriately respond to and mitigate the impact of cybersecurity incidents.</p> <p>Under s. 30CU of the Act, an entity responsible for a system of national significance may be required to undertake a vulnerability assessment in relation to all types of cybersecurity incidents.</p> <p>2.3 Security measures: Are organisations required under Applicable Laws to take measures to monitor, detect, prevent or mitigate Incidents? If so, please describe what measures are required to be taken.</p> <p>The ACSC is part of the Australian Signals Directorate (\u201cASD\u201d) of the Australian Government. The ACSC provides advice and guidance to individuals and families, small and medium business, organisation and critical infrastructure, and government on how to respond to and report cybersecurity incidents.</p> <p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (\u201cASIC\u201d) provides guidance to Australia\u2019s integrated corporate markets, financial services and consumer regulator, and organisations through its \u201ccyber reliance good practices\u201d. The good practices recommend, inter alia, periodic review of cyber strategy by a board of directors, using cyber resilience as a management tool, for corporate governance to be responsive (i.e. keeping cybersecurity policies and procedures up to date), collaboration and information sharing, third-party risk management and implementing continuous monitoring systems.</p> <p>The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (\u201cOAIC\u201d) recommends that entities have a data breach response plan that includes a strategy for containing, assessing and managing data breaches and strategies for containing and remediating data breaches.</p> <p>2.4 Reporting to authorities: Are organisations required under Applicable Laws, or otherwise expected by a regulatory or other authority, to report information related to Incidents or potential Incidents (including cyber threat information, such as malware signatures, network vulnerabilities and other technical characteristics identifying a cyber attack or attack methodology) to a regulatory or other authority in your jurisdiction? If so, please provide details of: (a) the circumstance in which this reporting obligation is triggered; (b) the regulatory or other authority to which the information is required to be reported; (c) the nature and scope of information that is required to be reported; and (d) whether any defences or exemptions exist by which the organisation might prevent publication of that information.</p> <p>Entities responsible for critical infrastructure assets have legislated obligations to report cybersecurity incidents, under the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018. The circumstances in which reporting is triggered are set out above at question 2.2. The entities are required to report the cybersecurity incident to the ACSC. In the report, the entity is to provide the date and time of the incident, identify whether the incident is ongoing, identify what systems are being impacted and identify the type of incident (such as denial of service, unauthorised access to network or device, data exposure, malicious code, ransomware, phishing or scanning).</p> <p>In February 2018, the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 amended the Privacy Act to require Australian Privacy Principles (\u201cAPP\u201d) entities to, as soon as practicable, provide notice to the OAIC and affected individuals of an \u201celigible data breach\u201d, where there are reasonable grounds to believe that an \u201celigible data breach\u201d has occurred. This process is called the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme (\u201cNDB Scheme\u201d).</p> <p>Eligible data breaches arise when: there is unauthorised access to or unauthorised disclosure of personal information, or a loss of personal information, that an entity holds; this unauthorised disclosure of personal information, or loss of personal information, is likely to result in serious harm to one or more individuals; and the entity has not been able to prevent the likely risk of serious harm with remedial action. Indicators such as malware signatures, observable network vulnerabilities and other \u201cred-flag\u201d technical characteristics may represent reasonable grounds for an APP entity to form a belief that an eligible data breach has occurred.</p> <p>The OAIC expects APP entities to conduct a quick assessment of a suspected data breach to determine whether it is likely to result in serious harm.</p> <p>The notification to the OAIC must include the identity and contact details of the organisation, a description of the data breach, the kinds of information concerned and recommendations about the steps that individuals should take in response to the data breach.</p> <p>Under the Privacy Act, an APP entity is defined as an \u201cagency\u201d or \u201corganisation\u201d. \u201cAgency\u201d includes a Minister, a department, and most government bodies, whilst \u201corganisation\u201d means an individual, a body corporate, a partnership, any other unincorporated association or a trust that is not a small business operator, a registered political party, an agency, a State or Territory authority or a prescribed instrumentality of a State or Territory.</p> <p>2.5 Reporting to affected individuals or third parties: Are organisations required under Applicable Laws, or otherwise expected by a regulatory or other authority, to report information related to Incidents or potential Incidents to any affected individuals? If so, please provide details of: (a) the circumstance in which this reporting obligation is triggered; and (b) the nature and scope of information that is required to be reported.</p> <p>In relation to data breaches, the affected individual must also be notified of an \u201celigible data breach\u201d, as defined above. The notification must include the identity and contact details of the organisation, a description of the data breach, the kinds of information concerned and recommendations about the steps that individuals should take in response to the data breach.</p> <p>2.6 Responsible authority(ies): Please provide details of the regulator(s) or authority(ies) responsible for the above-mentioned requirements.</p> <p>As discussed above, entities responsible for critical infrastructure assets are required to report to the ACSC, which is part of the ASD of the Australian Government. The ACSC\u2019s objective is to improve Australia\u2019s cybersecurity by monitoring cyber threats. The ACSC provides advice to individuals, businesses and critical infrastructure operators in relation to cybersecurity.</p> <p>Entities required to report data breaches report to the OAIC. The OAIC is an independent statutory agency within the Attorney- General\u2019s Department. The OAIC has three functions; namely, privacy functions conferred by the Privacy Act, freedom of information functions, such as reviewing the decisions made by agencies and Ministers pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth), and government information policy functions conferred by the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (Cth).</p> <p>In relation to its privacy functions, the OAIC has the power to commence investigations, conduct privacy performance assessments, request an entity to develop an enforceable code, direct an agency to give the OAIC a privacy impact assessment about a proposed activity or function and recognise external dispute resolution schemes to handle privacy-related complaints.</p> <p>2.7 Penalties: What are the penalties for not complying with the above-mentioned requirements?</p> <p>A failure to comply with notification obligations can result in the imposition of civil penalties. For example, if an entity responsible for a system of national significance fails to have an incident response plan for cybersecurity incidents, contrary to s. 30CD of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth), the maximum civil penalty is 200 penalty units. A body corporate is subject to a maximum penalty five times the amount listed, therefore making the maximum civil penalty 1,000 penalty units. This is currently a fine of AUD 222,000.</p> <p>Similarly, a serious or repeated interference with privacy attracts a fine of 2,000 penalty units, currently AUD 444,000. The maximum penalty that a court can order for a body corporate is five times the amount listed in the civil penalty provision, currently a maximum of AUD 2.1 million.</p> <p>2.8 Enforcement: Please cite any specific examples of enforcement action taken in cases of non-compliance with the above-mentioned requirements.</p> <p>Due to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth) recently being enacted and then amended by the Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure Protection) Act 2022, there has not been any enforcement action reported.</p> <p>The Privacy Act confers a number of additional enforcement powers on the OAIC, including accepting an enforceable undertaking, bringing proceedings to enforce an enforceable undertaking, making a determination, making orders that the APP entity must redress any loss or damage suffered by the complainant and that the complainant is entitled to payment of compensation for such loss or damage, bringing proceedings to enforce a determination, delivering a report to the responsible Minister and seeking an injunction.</p> <p>The OAIC reported that, in response to Commissioner-initiated investigations, enforceable undertakings were accepted by two APP entities during 2019, namely Wilson Asset Management (International) Pty Ltd, and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p>"},{"location":"TBS/Policy%20Toolkit/Cybersecurity%20Laws%20and%20Regulations%20Report%202023%20Aus/#3-preventing-attacks","title":"3.

First, let\u2019s talk about why your business needs to make backups a top priority.</p> <p>Small businesses are experiencing critical data loss on a daily basis. Losses occur as a result of many different failures, including:</p> <ul> <li>theft or loss of devices</li> <li>power failures (corrupting hard drives and data)</li> <li>arson and property damage</li> <li>cybercrime and data breaches (which over a quarter of small businesses face every year)</li> <li>virus and malware data corruption</li> </ul> <p>Just considering cybercrime, the most recent tally in 2017 reveals that there were over 500,000 successful cyber-attacks against Australian small businesses (SMBs). These attacks were mostly in the form of email or phishing scams, ransomware scams and hacking attempts, all of which often result in the loss of critical systems and key data assets.</p> <p>The reason that this data loss is so crippling is because of the kind of data at stake. Whenever data loss is mentioned, it refers to the irrecoverable loss of key assets such as:</p> <ul> <li>customer and financial records</li> <li>communication history (for example, emails)</li> <li>private or important documents held on computers and devices</li> <li>contact information of partners, suppliers or customers</li> <li>programs used to record and perform work</li> </ul> <p>These are just a few of the broad strokes that businesses commonly rely on to function. Businesses also tend to have unique systems and data assets that they depend on. When data loss occurs, it\u2019s these key data assets that are at stake, and it\u2019s the loss of these assets that is causing Australian businesses to fail.</p> <p>If you have experienced this already, you know the difference that could have been made if your data was backed up and secure.

And, the focus needs to shift from pure prevention to detection and response planning, the goal being to become resilient organisations that can bounce back quickly from attacks.","text":"<p>That is the advice from Tommy Viljoen, national security and resilience lead partner at Deloitte Australia, following the recent release of the Deloitte TMT Global Security Study, a survey of 121 global technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) companies.</p> <p>It found that businesses are underestimating how well prepared they are to prevent cyber attacks, with 88 per cent of survey participants not seeing their company as vulnerable and over 60 per cent rating their ability to mitigate newly developed threats as \u201caverage\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d.</p> <p>The survey\u2019s report states that this widespread confidence may not be realistic. It notes that even the US Government\u2019s National Security Agency works under the assumption that it has been compromised and builds its systems on the assumption that adversaries will get in.</p> <p>More than half (59 per cent) of the TMT organisations surveyed acknowledged that they experienced a security breach in the past year and of those incidents, seven per cent were considered high impact. Other organisations may have had their security breached without even realising it, the report notes.</p> <p>It says: \u201cThe truth is every organisation is vulnerable; 100 per cent prevention does not exist. That\u2019s why a combination of detection and incident response, in addition to prevention, is becoming more important. In fact, TMT organisations today are increasingly focusing on cyber resilience, not just security.\u201d</p> <p>Innovations in technology and how people use that technology were seen as the biggest security threat. More than three quarters of the respondents rated security breaches at third parties as one of their top three threats. As businesses become more reliant on third parties in their efforts to improve efficiencies (and as third parties develop their own downstream service networks and increasingly rely on the cloud), TMT organisations are concerned their data is, and will be, shared and exposed in ways they cannot control.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to effectively counter cyber risks, companies need to move beyond pure contractual arrangements with their suppliers and other third parties, such as government, and be more willing to collaborate and co-operate to reduce the weaker links,\u201d says Deloitte technology risk leader, Dean Kingsley. \u201cOnly 30 per cent of the participants believe third parties are shouldering enough responsibility for cyber security.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that the mobile and \u201cbring your own device\u201d (BYOD) trends continue to challenge security teams, with 74 per cent of survey participants ranking it as their second-biggest security risk. Despite this, only half indicated they have specific policies for mobile devices in place, and 10 per cent do not address BYOD risks at all.</p> <p>In addition, 70 per cent of survey respondents also listed their employees\u2019 lack of security awareness as an \u201caverage\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d vulnerability.</p> <p>According to the surveyed organisations, network-related protective technologies (such as firewalls and network zones) are by far the most effective methods. Security compliance tools are considered the least effective.</p> <p>\u201cHacktivism\u201d is referenced in the survey for the first time, with 63 per cent of participants rating it as a major concern. This combines social or political activism with hacking and seeking to block access to a company\u2019s online operations through a denial of service (DOS) attack.</p> <p>\u201cThis vulnerability to hacktivism reflects that cyber attacks can now come from anywhere, and be prompted by perceived controversial business practices and decisions, often highlighted through social media,\u201d says Viljoen.</p> <p>The survey found that one of the biggest obstacles to improving information security continues to be lack of budget, a barrier cited by 49 per cent of respondents. \u201cThis is an issue that organisations will need to address if they want to stay a step ahead of the threats,\u201d notes the report.</p>"},{"location":"TBS/Report%20%26%20Recover/Incident%20Response/Communication%20%26%20Engagement/External%20Communications/","title":"External Communications","text":"<p>Depending on the impact and severity of a cyber incident, it may be necessary to communicate with external stakeholders (including ministers, media and the public).
