Handshaking procedures  Handshaking procedures are the dialogue between two information systems for synchronizing, identifying, and authenticating themselves to one another.  Hard copy key  A hard copy key is physical keying material, such as printed key lists, punched or printed key tapes, or programmable, read-only memories.  Hardening  Hardening is also known as system hardening and refers to providing protection to a computer system at various layers such as host, application, os, user, physical levels, and all the other sublevels in between. A hardened computer system is a more secure computer system. Hardening eliminates as many risks and threats to a computer system as necessary.  Hardware  Hardware is the physical component of an information system. See also software and firmware.  Hardwired key  A hardwired key is a permanently installed key.  Hash based message authentication code hmac  Hash-based message authentication code is a message authentication code that uses a cryptographic key in conjunction with a hash function.  Hash function  A hash function is a function that is used to map data of arbitrary size to a data of a known or fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.  Hash functions  A cryptographic hash function is a kind of hash function where it is practically impossible to recreate the input data from its hash value alone. The input data is referred to as the ‘message’, and the hash value is called the ‘message digest’ or the ‘digest’. The result of this hash function can be used to validate if a larger file has been changed, without comparing the larger files. Examples of frequently used hash functions are md5 and sha1.  Hash total  A hash total is a method of verifying the accuracy of data; it includes adding up the data in different fields including fields, which have no significance such as account numbers, etc. The sum thus arrived should be the same as original, a mismatch in the totals indicates an error.  Hash value  A hash value is the result of applying a cryptographic hash function to data (e.g., a message).  Hashing  Hashing is a system of generating string values with the help of algorithms to maintain data integrity and accuracy.  Header  A header refers to the additional data at the beginning of a chunk of data (or packet) being stored or transmitted. The data that follows the header is called the payload or body. Note that it is important that the header is of clear and unambiguous format to allow for parsing.  High assurance guard hag  High assurance guard is an enclave boundary protection device that controls access between a local area network that an enterprise system has a requirement to protect, and an external network that is outside the control of the enterprise system, with a high degree of assurance. A guard that has two basic functional capabilities: a message guard and a directory guard. The message guard provides filter service for message traffic traversing the guard between adjacent security domains. The directory guard provides filter service for directory access and updates traversing the guard between adjacent security domains.  High availability  High availability is a failover feature to ensure availability during device or component interruptions.  High impact system  A high impact system is an information system in which at least one security objective (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, or availability) is assigned a fips 199 potential impact value of high. An information system in which at least one security objective (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, or availability) is assigned a potential impact value of high.  High impact  High impact is the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability that could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the national security interests of the united states; (i.e., 1) causes a severe degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; 2) results in major damage to organizational assets; 3) results in major financial loss; or 4) results in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life threatening injuries).  Hijack attack  A hijack attack is a form of active wiretapping in which the attacker seizes control of a previously established communication association.  Hijacking  Hijacking is a network security attack by which the intruder takes control of a connection, while a session is in progress. The intruder gains unauthorized access to the information.  Honeyclient  Honeyclient is a web browser-based high interaction client honeypot designed by Kathy Wang in 2004 and subsequently developed at mitre. It was the first open source client honeypot and is a mix of perl, c++, and ruby. Honeyclient is state-based and detects attacks on windows clients by monitoring files, process events, and registry entries.  Honeymonkey  A honeymonkey is an automated program that imitates a human user to detect and identify websites which exploit vulnerabilities on the internet. It is also known as a honey client.  Honeypot  Honeypot is a computer security program that simulates one or more network services that you define on your computer’s ports. An attacker may assume that you’re running weak services that can be used to break into the machine. A honeypot provides you advanced warning of a more concerted attack. Two or more honeypots on a network form a honeynet.  Hop  A hop occurs each time that a data packet is passed from one device (source) to the next device (destination). Data packets pass through bridges, routers, and gateways on the way.  Host based intrusion detection system hids  A host-based intrusion detection system (hids) is an intrusion detection system that monitors and analyses information from the operating system audit records occurring on the host. These operations are then compared to a predefined security policy norm. This analysis of the audit trail forces significant overhead requirements on the system due to the increased amount of processing power which must be utilized by the intrusion detection system. Depending on the size of the audit trail and the processing ability of the system, the review of audit data could result in the loss of a real-time analysis capability.  Host  A network host is a computer or other device connected to a computer network. A network host is a network node that is assigned a network layer host address. A network host may offer information resources, services, and applications to users or other nodes on the network.

Within a few hours, a hot site can become a fully functioning element of an organization.  Hot wash  A hot wash is a debrief conducted immediately after an exercise or test with the staff and participants.  Http proxy  An http proxy is a server that receives requests from your web browser and then, requests the internet on your behalf. It then returns the results to your browser.  Https  Https (also called http over tls, http over ssl, and http secure) is an internet protocol used for secure communication over a computer network. Https is very important over insecure networks (such as public wifi), as anyone on the same local network can discover sensitive information not protected by https. Https consists of communication over hypertext transfer protocol (http) within a connection encrypted by transport layer security or its predecessor, secure sockets layer.  Hub  A hub is a network device that is a common connection point for devices in a network. These are commonly used to connect segments of a lan. A hub contains multiple ports. When a data packet is received at one port, it is transmitted to the other ports on the hub.  Hybrid attack  A hybrid attack is a blend of both a dictionary attack method as well as brute force attack. This means that while a dictionary attack method would include a wordlist of passwords, the brute-force attack would be applied to each possible password in that list.  Hybrid encryption  Hybrid encryption is a method of encryption that combines two or more encryption algorithms or systems. This method merges asymmetric and symmetric encryption in order to derive benefit from the strengths of each form of encryption. These strengths include speed and security respectively.  Hybrid security control  Hybrid security control is a security control that is implemented in an information system in part as a common control and in part as a system-specific control.  Hyperlink  A hyperlink (usually highlighted by color or underscoring) could be a word, a phrase, or an image that refers to data or related information that the user can directly follow either by clicking or by hovering. A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document while a hypertext is text with hyperlinks.  Hypertext markup language html  Hypertext markup language (html) is a set of markup symbols or codes that are inserted in a file intended for display on a world wide web (www) browser page. This markup states the browser how to display a web page to the user.  Hypertext transfer protocol http  Http is the underlying protocol used by the world wide web (www).

Identity  Internet identity (iid) or internet persona is a social identity that an internet user creates on online communities and websites. While some users prefer using their real names online, others prefer to be anonymous and identify themselves by means of pseudonyms.  Incident handling  Incident handling is an action plan developed (by an organisation or individual) to counteract intrusions, cyber-theft, denial of service, fire, flood, and any other security-related events. It comprises six process steps: preparation, identification of attack, containment of attack, eradication, recovery, and analysis (lessons learned documentation).  Incident  An incident is an unplanned disruption or degradation of a network or system service and needs to be resolved immediately. An example of an incident is a server crash that causes a disruption in the business process. However, if the disruption is planned, say, a scheduled maintenance, it is not an incident.  Incremental backups  An incremental backup provides a backup of only those files that have changed, modified, or are new since the last backup. Incremental backups are often desirable as they consume minimum storage and are quicker to perform than differential backups.  Inetd  Inetd stands for internet service daemon and is a super-server daemon on many unix systems to manage several internet services. This reduces the load of the system. This means that the network services such as telnet, file transfer protocol (ftp), and simple mail transfer protocol (smtp) can be activated on demand rather than running continuously.  Inference attack  An inference attack is a data mining technique used to illegally access information about a subject or database by analyzing data. This is an example of breached information security. Such an attack occurs when a user is able to deduce key or critical information of a database from trivial information without directly accessing it.  Information warfare  Information warfare (iw) is primarily a United States military concept that involves the use and management of information and communication technology in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent. This concept may employ a combination of tactical information, assurance(s) that the information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralise or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of opposing force information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces.  Ingress filtering  Ingress filtering is used to ensure that all incoming packets (of data) are from the networks from which they claim to originate. Network ingress filtering is a commonly used packet filtering technique by many internet service providers to prevent any source address deceiving. This helps in combating several net abuse or crimes by making internet traffic traceable to its source.  Input validation attacks  Input validations attacks are when an attacker purposefully sends strange inputs to confuse a web application. Input validation routines serve as the first line of defence for such attacks. Examples of input validation attacks include buffer overflow, directory traversal, cross-site scripting and sql injection.  Integrity star property  Integrity star property means a user cannot access or read data of a lower integrity level than their own.  Integrity  Integrity of a system or network is the assurance that information can only be accessed or modified by those who are authorised. Several measures are taken to ensure integrity. These include controlling the physical environment of networked terminals and servers, restricting access to data, and maintaining rigorous authentication practices. Data integrity can be threatened by environmental hazards, such as heat, dust, and electrical surges.  Internet control message protocol icmp  The internet control message protocol (icmp) is one of the key internet protocols and is used by network devices such as routers to generate error messages to the source ip address when network problems prevent delivery of ip packets. Any ip network device has the capability to send, receive or process icmp messages. This protocol is also used to relay query messages and is assigned protocol number 1.  Internet engineering task force ietf  The internet engineering task force (ietf) is a large open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers who are concerned with the evolution of the internet architecture and its smooth operations. This body defines the standard internet operating protocols such as tcp/ip. The ietf is supervised by the internet society internet architecture board (iab). The internet assigned numbers authority (iana) is the central coordinator for the assignment of unique parameter values for internet protocols.  Internet message access protocol imap  The internet message access protocol (imap) is a standard internet protocol that is used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over tcp/ip. Imap is defined by rfc 3501. An imap server typically listens on port number 143. Imap over ssl (imaps) is assigned the port number 993.  Internet protocol ip  The internet protocol (ip) is a communication protocol that is used for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. It has a routing function which enables inter-networking, and essentially establishes the internet.  Internet protocol security ipsec  Internet protocol security (ipsec) is a protocol suite for secure internet protocol (ip) communications by authenticating and encrypting each ip packet of a communication session. Ipsec can be used in protecting data flows between a pair of hosts (host-to-host), security gateways (network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host (network-to-host).  Internet protocol  An internet protocol address (ip address) is a numerical label that is assigned to each device that is using internet protocol or any other protocol and is connected to an internet network. An ip address serves two basic functions, that is, host or network interface identification and location addressing.  Internet standard  An internet standard (std) is a normative specification (that is approved by the iesg and published as an rfc) of a technology or methodology applicable to the internet. Internet standards are created and published by the internet engineering task force (ietf). An internet standard is characterised by technical reliability and usefulness. The ietf also defines a proposed standard as a less mature but stable and well-reviewed specification.  Internet  The internet is the worldwide network of interconnected computers that use the internet protocol suite (or tcp/ip) to link billions of devices across globally. It carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the world wide web (www), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  Interrupt  An interrupt is a signal sent to the processor by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention.  Intranet  An intranet is a private or internal network that is accessible only to an organisation’s personnel. An intranet is established with the technologies for local area networks (lans) and wide area networks (wans).  Intrusion detection id  Intrusion detection (id) is a security management system for computers and networks. An id system gathers and analyses information on a computer or a network to identify possible security breaches which include both intrusions and misuse. This system uses vulnerability assessment which is a technology developed to assess the security of a computer system or network.  Ip flood  Ip flood is a type of denial of service attack where the victim or system is flooded with information that uses up all the available bandwidth and prevents legitimate users from access. When ip flood detection is enabled, the router has the ability to block malicious devices that are attempting to flood devices.  Ip forwarding  Ip forwarding is also known as internet routing. It is a process used to determine using which path a packet or datagram can be sent. Ip forwarding is an os option that allows a host to act as a router. A system that has more than one network interface card must have ip forwarding turned on in order for the system to be able to act as a router.  Ip spoofing  Ip spoofing is also known as ip address forgery or a host file hijack. It is a hijacking technique where a hacker impersonates as a trusted host to conceal his identity, spoof a website, hijack browsers, or gain access to a network.  Iso  The international organization for standardization (iso) is an international standard-setting body that is composed of voluntary representatives from various national standards organizations.  Issue specific policy  An issue-specific policy is intended to address specific needs within an organisation, such as a password policy.  Itu t  The itu telecommunication standardization sector (itu-t) is one of the three sectors of the international telecommunication union (itu). It coordinates standards for telecommunications. The international telegraph and telephone consultative committee (ccitt, from french: comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique) was created in 1956, and was renamed itu-t in 1993. Itu became a United Nations specialized agency in 1947.

Kerberos  Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol and is ticket-based allowing nodes to communicate over a non-secure. Massachusetts institute of technology (mit) developed the kerberos to protect network services provided by the project athena. This protocol is based on the earlier needham–schroeder symmetric key protocol. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against snooping and replay attacks.  Kernel  The kernel is an essential center of a computer operating system, the core that provides basic services for all other parts of the operating system. A synonym is nucleus. A kernel can be contrasted with a shell, the outermost part of an operating system that interacts with user commands. Kernel and shell are terms used more frequently in unix operating systems than in ibm mainframe or microsoft windows systems.

Lattice techniques  Lattice techniques use security designations to determine access to information.  Layer 2 forwarding protocol l2f  Layer 2 forwarding protocol (l2f) is an internet protocol, originally developed by cisco corporation, that uses tunnelling of ppp over ip to create a virtual extension of a dial-up link across a network, initiated by the dial-up server and transparent to the dial-up user.  Layer 2 tunneling protocol l2tp  An extension of the point-to-point tunneling protocol used by an internet service provider to enable the operation of a virtual private network over the internet.  Least privilege  Least privilege is the principle of allowing users or applications the least amount of permissions necessary to perform their intended function.  Legion  A legion is a software used to detect unprotected shares.  Lightweight directory access protocol ldap  Lightweight directory access protocol (ldap) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an ip network.  Link state  Link-state routing protocols are one of the two main classes of routing protocols used in packet switching networks. The link-state protocol is performed by every switching node in the network. Every node creates a map of the connectivity to the network (in the form of a graph) displaying all the nodes that are connected to other nodes. Each node then calculates the next best logical path from it to every possible destination in the network. The collection of these best paths forms the node’s routing table.  List based access control  List based access control associates a list of users and their privileges with each object, such as a file directory or individual file. Each object has a security attribute that identifies its access control list. The list has an entry for each system user with access privileges. This list is implemented differently by each operating system.  Loadable kernel modules lkm  Loadable kernel modules (lkm) is an object file that contains code to extend the running kernel or the base kernel of an operating system. Lkms are usually used to add support for new hardware and/or file systems, and even for adding system calls.  Log clipping  Log clipping is the selective removal of log entries from a system log to hide a compromise.  Logic bombs  A logic bomb is a piece of code that is deliberately inserted into a system to trigger a malicious program. Viruses and worms often contain logic bombs that execute a certain payload at a pre-defined time or when some other condition is met. Some viruses attack their host systems on specific dates, such as friday the 13th or april fools’ day. Trojans that activate on certain dates are often called time bombs.  Logic gate  A logic gate is an elementary building block of a digital circuit. This device is used to implement a boolean function. It performs a logical operation on one or more logical inputs, and produces a single logical output.  Loopback address  A loopback address is a pseudo address that sends outgoing signals back to the same computer for testing. In a tcp/ip network, the loopback ip address is 127.0.0.1, and pinging this address always returns a reply unless the firewall prevents it.

Mac addresses are used in the media access control protocol sub-layer of the osi reference model.  Malicious code  Malicious code is any code in any part of a software system or script that is intended to cause undesired effects, security breaches, or damage to a system. Such codes actually gain unauthorised access to system resources or trick a user into executing other malicious logic. Malicious code describes a broad category of system security terms that includes attack scripts, viruses, worms, trojan horses, backdoors, and malicious active content.  Malware  Malware is a short term used for malicious software. Malware is defined as any software that is used to interrupt or disrupt computer operations, gather sensitive information, or gain access to certain files or programs.  Mandatory access control mac  Mandatory access control (mac) is a security approach that contains the ability of an individual resource owner to grant or deny access to resources or files on the system. Whenever a user tries to access an object, an authorisation rule is enforced by the os. Kernel examines these security aspects and decides whether the user can access or not. Any operation by any user is typically tested against a set of authorisation rules (aka policy) to determine if the operation is allowed.  Masquerade attack  A masquerade attack is any attack that uses a forged identity (such as a network identity) to gain unofficial access to a personal or organisational computer. Masquerade attacks are generally performed by using either stolen passwords and logins, locating gaps in programs, or finding a way around the authentication process. Such attacks are triggered either by someone within the organisation or by an outsider if the organisation is connected to a public network.  Md5  The md5 was designed by professor ronald l. Rivest of mit in 1991. The md5 message-digest algorithm is the most widely used cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically expressed in text format as a 32 digit hexadecimal number. It was developed to be used with digital signature applications that require large files to be compressed by a secure method before being encrypted with a secret key, under a public key cryptosystem. Md5 is currently a standard internet engineering task force (ietf) request for comments (rfc) 1321.  Measures of effectiveness moe  The measures of effectiveness (moe) is a probability model based on engineering concepts that allows one to estimate the impact of a given action on an environment. Moe quantifies the results to be obtained by a system and may be expressed as probabilities that the system will perform as required.  Monoculture  Monoculture is the case where a large number of users run the same software, and are vulnerable to the same attacks.  Morris worm  The morris worm (or internet worm) program was written by a graduate student at cornell university, robert tappan morris, and launched on november 2, 1988 from mit. It was the first computer worm distributed via the internet and gained significant mainstream media attention.  Multicast  An ip multicast is a method of sending packets of data to a group of receivers in a single transmission. This method is often used to stream media applications on the internet and private networks.  Multi homed  Multi-homed is any computer host that has multiple ip addresses to connected networks. A multi-homed host is physically connected to multiple data links that can be on the same or different networks. Multihoming is commonly used in web management for load balancing, redundancy, and disaster recovery.  Multiplexing  Multiplexing is a technique by which multiple analog or digital data streams are combined into one signal over a shared medium. Multiplexing originated in telegraphy in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications. The multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel, such as a cable. A reverse process, known as demultiplexing, extracts the original channels on the receiver end.

Nat  Network address translation (nat) is an approach that is used to remap an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in ip datagram packet headers while they are in transit. This technique was originally used for rerouting traffic in ip networks without renumbering every host. Typically home or small business networks use nat to share a single dsl or cable modem ip address. However, in some cases nat is used for servers as an additional layer of protection.  National institute of standards and technology nist  The national institute of standards and technology (nist) is a non-regulatory federal agency within the u.s. department of commerce. NIST’s mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.  Natural disaster  Natural disasters are any act of god or natural event caused by environmental factors. Some examples of these disasters include fire, flood, earthquake, lightning, or wind and disables the system, part of it, or a network of systems.  Netmask  A netmask is a string of 0’s and 1’s that screens out the network part of an ip address so that only the host computer part of the address remains. The binary 1’s at the beginning of the mask turn the network id part of the ip address into 0’s. The binary 0’s that follow allow the host id to remain. In a netmask, two bits are always automatically assigned. For example, in 255.255.225.0, “0” is the assigned network address, and in 255.255.255.255, “255” is the assigned broadcast address. The 0 and 255 are always assigned and cannot be used.  Network based ids  Network-based intrusion detection systems (nids) are placed at a strategic point (or points) to monitor the traffic on the network. It analyses the passing traffic on the entire subnet, and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks. When an attack is identified, or abnormal behaviour is detected, an alert is sent to the administrator. Opnet and netsim are commonly used tools for simulation network intrusion detection systems.  Network mapping  Network mapping is the study of physical connectivity of networks. It is used to compile an electronic inventory of the systems and the services on any network. With the increase in complexities of networks, automated network mapping has become more popular.  Network taps  Network taps are hardware devices that help in accessing the data flow across a computer network. It is also desirable for a third party to monitor the traffic between two points in the network. The network tap has (at least) three ports, an a port, a b port, and a monitor port. Network taps are generally used for network intrusion detection systems, voip recording, network probes, rmon probes, packet sniffers, and other monitoring and collection devices and software that require access to a network segment.  Non printable character  A non-printable character is a character that doesn’t have a corresponding character letter to its corresponding ascii code. Examples would be the linefeed, which is ascii character code 10 decimal, the carriage return, which is 13 decimal, or the bell sound, which is decimal 7. On a pc, you can often add non-printable characters by holding down the alt key, and typing in the decimal value (i.e., alt-007 gets you a bell). There are other character encoding schemes, but ascii is the most prevalent.  Non repudiation  Non-repudiation refers to the ability of a system to prove that a specific user and only that specific user sent a message and that it hasn’t been modified. On the internet, a digital signature is used not only to ensure that a message or document has been electronically signed by the person, but also, since a digital signature can only be created by one person, to ensure that a person cannot later deny that they furnished the signature.  Null session  A null session is also known as anonymous logon. It is a method that allows an anonymous user to retrieve information such as user names and share this over the network, or connect without authentication. Null sessions are one of the most commonly used methods for network exploration employed by “hackers.” A null session connection allows you to connect to a remote machine without using a username or password. Instead, you are given anonymous or guest access.

Octet  An octet is a unit of digital information that consists of eight bits. Octets are generally displayed using a variety of representations, for example in the hexadecimal, decimal, or octal number systems. The binary value of all 8 bits set (or turned on) is 11111111, equal to the hexadecimal value ff, the decimal value 255, and the octal value 377. One octet can be used to represent decimal values ranging from 0 to 255.  One way encryption  One-way encryption or one-way hash function is designed in a manner that it is hard to reverse the process, that is, to find a string that hashes to a given value (hence the name one-way). A good hash function makes it hard to find two strings that would produce the same hash value.  One way function  A one-way function is any function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input.  Open shortest path first ospf  An open shortest path first (ospf) is a routing protocol for ip networks and uses a link-state routing algorithm. It falls into the group of interior routing protocols, operating within a single autonomous system (as). Ospf is the most commonly used interior gateway protocol (igp) in large enterprise networks.  Osi layers  The open system interconnection (osi) model defines a networking framework to implement protocols in seven layers. Control is passed from one layer to the next, starting at the application layer in one station, and proceeding to the bottom layer, over the channel to the next station and back up the hierarchy. The osi model takes the task of internetworking and divides that up into what is referred to as a vertical stack that consists of the following layers. 1. Physical (layer 1) – this layer conveys the bit stream, electrical impulse, light, or radio signal through the network at the electrical and mechanical level. Fast ethernet, rs232, and atm are protocols with physical layer components. 2. Data link (layer 2) – at this layer, data packets are encoded and decoded into bits. The data link layer is divided into two sub layers: the media access control (mac) layer and the logical link control (llc) layer. 3. Network (layer 3) – this layer provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical paths, known as virtual circuits, for transmitting data from node to node. 4. Transport (layer 4) – this layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems, or hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. It ensures complete data transfer. 5. Session (layer 5) – this layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications. 6. Presentation (layer 6) – this layer provides independence from differences in data representation (e.g., encryption) by translating from application to network format, and vice versa. 7. Application (layer 7) – this layer supports application and end-user processes. This layer provides application services for file transfers, e-mail, and other network software services. Telnet and ftp are applications that exist entirely at the application level.  Osi  Osi stands for open system interconnection and is an iso standard for worldwide communications. Osi defines a networking framework for implementing protocols in seven layers. Osi defines seven layers of functions that take place at each end of a communication. Although osi is not always strictly adhered to in terms of keeping related functions together in a well-defined layer, many products involved in telecommunication attempt to describe themselves in relation to the osi model.  Overload  Overload is defined as the limitation of system operation by excessive burden on the performance capabilities of a system component.

Packet switched network psn  A packet switched network (psn) is a computer communications network that groups and sends data in the form of small packets. It enables sending of data packets between a source and destination node over a channel that is shared between multiple users and/or applications. A packet switch is also known as a connectionless network, as it does not create a permanent connection between a source and destination node.  Packet  A packet is a unit of data that is routed between an origin and a destination on the internet or any other packet-switched network. When any file (such as e-mail message, html file, graphics interchange format file, uniform resource locator request) is sent from one place to another, the transmission control protocol (tcp) layer of tcp/ip divides the file into smaller chunks ideal for routing.  Partitions  Partitioning is the division of a computer hard disk or other secondary storage into one or more regions. Many computers have hard disk drives with only a single partition but others have multiple partitions so that an os can manage information in each region separately. Each partition then appears in the os as a distinct logical disk that uses part of the actual disk.  Password authentication protocol pap  Password authentication protocol (pap) is the most basic form of authentication in which a user’s name and password are transmitted over a network and compared to a table of name-password pairs. The basic authentication feature built into the http protocol uses pap.  Password cracking  Password cracking is the process of trying to guess or crack passwords to gain access to a computer system or network. Crackers generally use a variety of tools, scripts, or software to crack a system password. Password cracks work by comparing every encrypted dictionary word against the entries in the system password file until a match is found.  Password sniffing  Password sniffing is a technique used to gain knowledge of passwords that involves monitoring traffic on a network to pull out information. There are several softwares available for automatic password sniffing.  Patch  A patch is a piece of software designed and created to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, usually called bug fixes. Each patch is created to improve the usability and/or performance of the system or application.  Patching  Patching is the process of updating software to a different version. It is also referred to as updating the software to the latest version available and is key in removing bugs of the previous version.  Payload  A payload is the actual application data a packet contains. It is part of the transmitted data which is the fundamental purpose of the transmission. In summary, payload refers to the actual intended message in a transmission.  Penetration testing  Penetration testing is also called pen testing. It is the practice of testing a computer system, network or web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker or attacker could exploit.  Penetration  Penetration is defined as gaining unauthorised logical access to sensitive data by evading a system’s protections.  Permutation  Permutation is a technique that keeps the same letters but changes the position within a text to scramble the message.  Personal firewall  Personal firewalls are those firewalls that are installed and run on individual computers. A personal firewall is an application which controls network traffic to and from a computer, permitting or denying communications based on a security policy. Typically it works as an application layer firewall.  Pharming  Pharming is defined as a cyber attack that is intended to redirect a website’s traffic to a masquerading website, which may be a fake one. Pharming is achieved by corrupting a dns server on the internet and steering a url to the masked website’s ip. Generally all users use a url like www.worldbank.com instead of the real ip (192.86.99.140) of the website. The url can be redirected to send traffic to the ip of the pseudo website by substituting the pointers on a dns server. The transactions can be imitated and information like login credentials can be gathered at the pseudo site. Using the information gathered, the attacker can access the real site and conduct transactions using the credentials of a valid user.  Phishing  Phishing is an attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by impersonating as a trustworthy entity. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware. Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one.  Ping of death  A ping of death is an attack that involves sending a distorted or otherwise malicious ping to a computer with the intent of overflowing the input buffers of the destination machine and causing it to crash. A ping of death is fragmented into groups of 8 octets before transmission.  Ping scan  A ping scan looks for machines that are responding to icmp echo requests.  Ping sweep  A ping sweep is a technique that is used to establish a range of ip addresses mapping to live hosts. Well-known tools with ping sweep capability include nmap for unix systems, and the pinger software from rhino9 for windows nt. There are many other tools with this capability, including: hping, simple nomad’s icmpenum, solarwinds ping sweep, and foundstone’s superscan. Pings can be detected by protocol loggers like ippl.  Plaintext  Plaintext is the most portable format and is supported by almost every application. In cryptography, plaintext refers to any message that is not encrypted.  Point to point protocol ppp  Point-to-point protocol (ppp) is a communication protocol between two computers that uses a serial interface, typically a personal computer connected by a phone line to a server. Ppp uses the internet protocol (ip) and is sometimes considered a member of the tcp/ip suite of protocols.  Point to point tunneling protocol pptp  The point-to-point tunneling protocol (pptp) is an approach used to implement virtual private networks (vpn). Pptp uses a control channel over tcp and a gre tunnel operating to encapsulate ppp packets.  Poison reverse  Poison reverse is a method where the gateway node communicates its neighbour gateways that one of the gateways is no longer connected. The notifying gateway sets the number of hops to the unconnected gateway to a number that indicates “infinite”. In effect, advertising the fact that their routes are not reachable.  Polyinstantiation  Polyinstantiation is the ability of a database to maintain multiple records with the same key. It is used to prevent inference attacks. It may also indicate, such as in the case of database polyinstantiation, that two different instances have the same name (identifier, primary key).  Polymorphism  Polymorphism is the process where malicious software changes its underlying code to avoid detection. A polymorphic type is one whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type, or types.  Port scan  A port scan is a sequence of messages sent by an attacker attempting to break into a computer. Port scanning provides the attacker an idea where to probe for weaknesses. A port scan consists of sending a message to each port, one at a time.  Port  A port is an end point of communication in an operating system. It is identified for each address and protocol by a 16-bit number, commonly known as the port number.  Possession  Possession is the holding, control, and ability to use information.  Post office protocol version 3 pop3  Post office protocol, version 3 (pop3) is an internet standard protocol through which a client workstation can access a mailbox on a server host to retrieve mail messages that the server has received and is holding for the client.  Practical extraction and reporting language perl  Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, dynamic programming languages. These languages include perl 5 and perl 6. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose unix scripting language.  Preamble  A preamble is a signal used in communications to synchronize the transmission timing between two or more systems. A preamble defines a specific series of transmission pulses that is understood by communicating systems. This ensures that systems receiving the information correctly interpret when the data transmission starts. The actual pulses used as a preamble vary depending on the network communication technology in use.  Pretty good privacy pgp tm  Pretty good privacy (pgp) tm is a trademark data encryption and decryption program. This program provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. It was created by phil zimmermann in 1991. Pgp is generally used for encrypting and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.  Private addressing  Iana has set aside three address ranges for use by private or non-internet connected networks. This is referred to as private address space and is defined in rfc 1918. The reserved address blocks are: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix) 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix).  program infector  A program infector is a piece of malware (or virus) that attaches itself to existing program files. Once the original infected program is run the virus transfers to the computer memory and may replicate itself further, spreading the infection. This type of virus can be spread beyond one’s system as soon as the infected file or program is passed to another computer.  Program policy  A program policy is a high-level policy that sets the overall tone of an organisation’s security approach.  Promiscuous mode  Promiscuous mode allows a network device to intercept and read each network packet that reaches in its entirety. This is used by network administrators to diagnose network problems, but also by unsavoury characters who are trying to eavesdrop on network traffic (which might contain passwords or other information).  Proprietary information  Proprietary information is that information unique to a company and its ability to compete, such as customer lists, technical data, product costs, and trade secrets.  Protocol stacks osi  Protocol stacks are a set of network protocol layers that work together.  Protocol  A protocol is a special set of rules that end points in a telecommunication connection when they communicate. Protocols specify interactions between the communicating entities. Protocols exist at several levels in a telecommunication connection.  Proxy server  A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A proxy server is associated with or part of a gateway server that separates the enterprise network from the outside network and a firewall server that protects the enterprise network from outside intrusion. Most proxies are web proxies, facilitating access to content on the world wide web and providing anonymity.  Public key encryption  Public key encryption is also known as asymmetric cryptography. Public key encryption is a cryptographic system that uses two keys, a public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the message.  Public key forward secrecy pfs  Public-key forward secrecy (pfs) is a key agreement protocol based on asymmetric cryptography. It ensures that a session key derived from a set of long-term public and private keys will not be compromised if one of the private keys is compromised in the future.  Public key infrastructure pki  A public key infrastructure (pki) is a set of hardware, software, people, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. It enables users of an unsecured network to securely exchange data and money through the use of a public and a private cryptographic key pair that is obtained through a trusted authority. The public key infrastructure provides for a digital certificate that can identify an individual or an organization and directory services that can store and, when necessary, revoke the certificates.  Public key  A public key is the publicly-disclosed component of a pair of cryptographic keys used for asymmetric cryptography.

Race condition  Race condition is also known as race hazard. Race condition is the behavior of an electronic, software, or other system where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. This becomes a bug when events don’t happen in the order the programmer planned. Race conditions can occur in electronics systems, especially logic circuits, and in computer software, especially multithreaded or distributed programs.  Radiation monitoring  Radiation monitoring is the process of receiving images, data, or audio from an unprotected source by snooping to radiation signals.  Reconnaissance  Reconnaissance is the phase of an attack where an attacker is able to locate new systems, maps out several networks, and probes for specific vulnerabilities in the system or network. It is used to obtain information by either visual observation or other detection methods about the activities and resources of an attacker.  Reflexive acls cisco  Reflexive access lists are an important part of securing the network against network hackers and is generally included in a firewall defence. Reflexive access lists provide a level of security against spoofing and denial-of-service attacks. Reflexive acls for Cisco routers are a step towards making the router act like a stately firewall. The router makes filtering decisions based on whether connections are a part of established traffic or not.  Registry  Registry is a system-defined database where applications and system components store and retrieve configuration data. Applications use the registry api to retrieve, modify, or delete registry data.  Regression analysis  The use of scripted tests which are used to test software for all possible input is expected. Typically developers will create a set of regression tests that are executed before a new version of a software is released.  Request for comment rfc  A request for comments (rfc) is a type of publication from the internet engineering task force (ietf) and the internet society.

Reverse address resolution protocol rarp  Reverse address resolution protocol (rarp) is a protocol where a physical machine in a local area network (lan) can request to learn its ip address from a gateway server’s address resolution protocol (arp) table or cache. When a new machine is set up, its rarp client program requests from the rarp server on the router to be sent its ip address.  Reverse engineering  Reverse engineering is also known as the “back engineering” and is the process of extracting design information or any kind of sensitive information by disassembling and analyzing the design of a system component.  Reverse lookup  The reverse lookup is used to locate the hostname that corresponds to a particular ip address. Reverse lookup uses an ip (internet protocol) address to find a domain name.  Reverse proxy  A reverse proxy is a device or service that is placed between a client and a server in a network. All the incoming http requests are handled by the proxy (back-end web servers), so the proxy can then send the content to the end-user.  Risk assessment  Risk assessment is a systematic process to analyze and identify any possible threats or risks that may leave sensitive information vulnerable to attacks. It also employs methods to calculate the risk impact and eliminate such threats.  Risk averse  Risk averse means avoiding risks even if this leads to the loss of opportunity. An example is using a (more expensive) phone call vs. Sending an email in order to avoid risks associated with email may be considered “risk averse”.  Risk  Risk is the probability of a system or network attack. Risk is the potential of losing valuable and sensitive information.  Rivest shamir adleman rsa  Rivest-shamir-adleman (rsa) is one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. Rsa is an algorithm for asymmetric cryptography, invented in 1977 by ron rivest, adi shamir, and leonard adleman. This is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.  Role based access control  Role based access control (rbac) assigns users to roles based on their organizational functions and determines authorization based on those roles. It is used by enterprises with more than 500 employees, and can implement mandatory access control (mac) or discretionary access control (dac).  Root  Root is the user name or account that by default has access to all commands and files on a linux or other unix-like operating system. It is also referred to as the root account, root user and the super user.  Rootkit  A rootkit is a type of malicious software that is activated each time the system boots up. Rootkits are difficult to detect as they are activated before your system’s operating system has completely booted up.  Router  A router is a device that forwards or transfers data packets across networks. A router is connected to at least two networks, commonly two lans or wans or a lan and its isp’s network. Routers are located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect.  Routing information protocol rip  The routing information protocol (rip) defines a manner for routers to share information on how to route traffic among various networks. Rip is classified by the internet engineering task force (ietf) as an interior gateway protocol (igp), one of several protocols for routers moving traffic around within a larger autonomous system network.  Routing loop  A routing loop is where two or more poorly configured routers repeatedly exchange the same data packet over and over. In case of distance vector protocols, the fact that these protocols route by rumor and have a slow convergence time can cause routing loops.  Rpc scans  Rpc scans determine which rpc services are running on a machine.  Rule set based access control rsbac  Rule set based access control (rsbac) targets actions based on rules for entities operating on objects. Rsbac is an open source access control framework for current linux kernels, which has been in stable production use since january 2000.

Secret key  A secret key is a cryptographic key that is used with a secret-key (symmetric) cryptographic algorithm that is uniquely associated with one or more entities and is not made public. The use of the term “secret” in this context does not imply a classification level, but rather implies the need to protect the key from disclosure. A secret key is also a cryptographic key that is used with a symmetric cryptographic algorithm that is uniquely associated with one or more entities and is not made public. The use of the term “secret” in this context does not imply a classification level, but rather implies the need to protect the key from disclosure. A secret key is also a cryptographic key that must be protected from unauthorized disclosure to protect data encrypted with the key. The use of the term “secret” in this context does not imply a classification level; rather, the term implies the need to protect the key from disclosure or substitution. A secret key is also a cryptographic key that is uniquely associated with one or more entities. The use of the term “secret” in this context does not imply a classification level, but rather implies the need to protect the key from disclosure or substitution.

Secure hash algorithm sha  Secure hash algorithm (sha) is a hash algorithm with the property that is computationally infeasible 1) to find a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or 2) to find two different messages that produce the same message digest.  Secure hash standard  The secure hash standard specifies secure hash algorithms -sha-1, sha-224, sha-256, sha-384, sha-512, sha-512/224 and sha-512/256 -for computing a condensed representation of electronic data (message). When a message of any length less than 2 64 bits (for sha-1, sha224 and sha-256) or less than 2 128 bits (for sha-384, sha-512, sha-512/224 and sha-512/256) is input to a hash algorithm, the result is an output called a message digest. The message digests range in length from 160 to 512 bits, depending on the algorithm. Secure hash algorithms are typically used with other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed-hash message authentication codes, or in the generation of random numbers (bits). The hash algorithms specified in this standard are called secure because, for a given algorithm, it is computationally infeasible 1) to find a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or 2) to find two different messages that produce the same message digest. Any change to a message will, with a very high probability, result in a different message digest. This will result in a verification failure when the secure hash algorithm is used with a digital signature algorithm or a keyed-hash message authentication algorithm. In addition, a secure hash standard is a specification for a secure hash algorithm that can generate a condensed message representation called a message digest.

Optional security services include signed receipts, security labels, secure mailing lists, and an extended method of identifying the signer’s certificate(s).  Smurf attack  A smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack in which large numbers of internet control message protocol (icmp) packets with the intended victim’s spoofed source ip are broadcast to a computer network using an ip broadcast address. Most devices on a network respond to this by sending a reply to the source ip address. This can slow down the victim’s computer to the point where it becomes impossible to work on.  Sniffer  A sniffer is a tool that monitors network traffic that is received in a network interface.  Sniffing  Sniffing is also known as passive wiretapping. Packet sniffing allows individuals to capture data as it is transmitted over a network. Packet sniffer programs are used by network professionals to diagnose network issues and by malicious users to capture unencrypted data like passwords and usernames in network traffic. Once this information is captured, the user can then gain access to the system or network.  Social engineering  Social engineering is a non-technical technique that intrusion hackers commonly use. This approach relies on human interaction and often involves tricking people into breaking normal security procedures.  Socket pair  A socket pair is a way to uniquely specify a connection, i.e., source ip address, source port, destination ip address, destination port.  Socket  A socket is an endpoint for communication between two systems. The socket tells a host’s ip stack where to plug in a data stream so that it connects to the right application.  Socks  Socket secure (socks) is an internet protocol that routes network or data packets between a client and server through a proxy server. Socks ensures proper authentication of users and allows authorised users only to access a server. Socks uses sockets to represent and keep track of individual connections. The client side of socks is built into certain web browsers and the server side can be added to a proxy server.

The central node provides a common connection point for all nodes through a hub.  Star property  A star property is a user who is unable to write data to a lower classification level without logging in at that lower classification level when using star property.  State machine  A state machine is any device that stores the status of something at a given time and can operate on input to change the status and cause an action to take place for any given change. A computer is basically a state machine and each machine instruction is input that changes one or more states and may cause other actions to take place. Each computer’s data register stores a state. The read-only memory from which a boot program is loaded stores a state.  Stateful inspection  Stateful inspection is also known as dynamic packet filtering. It is a firewall technology that monitors the state of active connections and uses this information to determine which network packets to allow through the firewall.  Static host tables  Static host tables are text files that contain hostname and address mapping.  Static routing  Static routing is a form of routing that occurs when a router uses a manually-configured routing entry, rather than information from a dynamic routing traffic.

Stealthing  Stealthing is a term that refers to approaches used by malicious code to conceal its presence on the infected system.  Steganalysis  Steganalysis is the study of detecting and defeating the use of steganography. This is analogous to cryptanalysis applied to cryptography.  Steganography  Steganography is a technique used to hide the existence of a message, files, or any other information. The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his steganographia.

Sub network  A sub network is a separately identifiable part of a larger network that typically represents a certain limited number of host computers, the hosts in a building or geographic area, or the hosts on an individual local area network.  Subnet mask  A subnet mask is used to determine the number of bits that are used for the subnet and host portions of the address. It is used as a screen of numbers used for routing traffic within a subnet. Once a packet has arrived at a gateway or connection point with its unique network number, it can be routed to its destination within the internal gateways using the subnet number.  Switch  A switch is also called switching hub, bridging hub, officially mac bridge. It is a computer networking device that connects devices together on a computer network by using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device.

T1 t3  A t1, t3 is a digital circuit using tdm (time-division multiplexing).  Tamper  Tamper is defined as deliberately trying to change or alter a system’s logic, data, or control information to cause the system to perform unauthorized functions or services.  Tcp fingerprinting  Tcp/ip stack fingerprinting is the passive collection of configuration attributes from a remote device during standard layer 4 network communications. The combination of parameters may be used to infer the remote machine’s operating system (os), or incorporated into a device fingerprint.  Tcp full open scan  A tcp full open scan checks each and every port after performing a full three-way handshake on each port to determine if it was open.  Tcp half open scan  A tcp half open scan determines if a port is open by performing the first half of a three-way handshake. It is also referred to as the syn scanning. In syn scanning, the hostile client or attacker attempts to set up a tcp/ip connection with a server at every possible port. This is done by sending a syn (synchronization) packet, as if to initiate a three-way handshake, to every port on the server.  Tcp wrapper  A tcp wrapper is a software package that is used to restrict access to certain network services based on the source of the connection. In other words, it is a host-based networking acl system, used to filter network access to internet protocol servers on (unix-like) operating systems such as gnu/linux or bsd.  Tcpdump  A tcpdump is a freeware protocol analyzer for unix systems that can monitor network traffic on a wire. It allows the user to display tcp/ip and other packets being transmitted or received over a network. Tcpdump works on most unix-like operating systems: linux, solaris, bsd, os x, hp-ux, android and aix among others. It was originally written in 1987 by van jacobson, craig leres and steven mccanne who were working in the lawrence berkeley laboratory network research group.  Tcp ip  Tcp/ip stands for transmission control protocol/internet protocol. It is a basic communication language or protocol of the internet and can be used as a communications protocol in a private network as well (either an intranet or an extranet).  Telnet  Telnet is a tcp-based, application-layer, internet standard protocol and an essential tcp/ip protocol for accessing remote computers. Through telnet, an administrator or another user can access someone else’s computer remotely.  Threat agent  Threat assessment  Threat assessment is a structured process used to identify and evaluate various risks or threats that an organization might be exposed to.  Threat model  A threat model is a process that is used to optimize network security by identifying the key objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system or network.  Threat vector  A threat vector is a methodology that a threat uses to get to the target.  Threat  A threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability to violate security protocols and thus, cause possible harm. A threat can be either deliberate (example, an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or accidental (example, the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado) or otherwise a circumstance, capability, action, or event.  Time to live  Time to live (ttl) or the hop limit is a mechanism that limits the lifespan of data in a computer or network. Ttl is generally implemented as a counter or time stamp attached to or embedded in the data. Ttl value in an ip data packet tells a network router whether or not the packet has been in the network too long and should be discarded.  Tiny fragment attack  A tiny fragment attack is ip fragmentation that is the process of breaking up a single internet protocol (ip) datagram into multiple packets of smaller size. Every network link has a characteristic size of messages that may be transmitted, called the maximum transmission unit (mtu). If the data packet size is made small enough to force some of a tcp packet’s tcp header fields into the second data fragment, filter rules that specify patterns for those fields will not match. If the filtering implementation does not enforce a minimum fragment size, a disallowed packet might be passed because it didn’t hit a match in the filter. Std 5, rfc 791 states that, “every internet module must be able to forward a datagram of 68 octets without further fragmentation.” This is because an internet header may be up to 60 octets, and the minimum fragment is 8 octets. Ip fragmentation exploits (attacks) use the fragmentation protocol within ip as an attack vector.  Token based access control  Token-based access control is an authentication method that offers additional security. Using this method, each user has a smart card or token that either displays a constantly changing password, passkey, or buttons that calculate a new password based on a challenge phrase. Without this card or token, it is impossible to authenticate yourself to the system. This two-factor authentication provides additional security by requiring an attacker to both guess the user’s password and steal the smart card or token that is used to access the system.  Token based devices  A token-based device or a security token is known by several names such as, hardware token, authentication token, usb token, cryptographic token, software token, virtual token, or key fob. A security token may be a physical device that an authorized user is given to access a system or network. Security tokens are used to prove one’s identity electronically and are used in addition to or in place of a password to prove that the customer is who they claim to be. The token acts like an electronic key to access something.  Token ring  A token ring network is a local area network in which all computers are connected in a ring or star topology and a binary digit or token-passing scheme is used in order to prevent the collision of data between two computers that want to send messages at the same time. It uses a special three-byte frame called a “token” that travels around a logical “ring” of workstations or servers.  Topology  Topology is the geometric arrangement of a computer system. Common topologies include a bus, star, and ring. Two networks have the same topology if the connection configuration is the same, although the networks may differ in physical interconnections, distances between nodes, transmission rates, and/or signal types.  Traceroute tracert exe  Traceroute is a tool that maps the route a packet takes from the local machine to a remote destination. The history of the route is recorded as the round-trip times of the packets received from each successive host (remote node) in the route (path). The sum of the mean times in each hop indicates the total time spent to establish the connection.  Transmission control protocol tcp  Transmission control protocol (tcp) is a set of rules or protocol that is used along with the internet protocol to send data in the form of message units between computers over the internet. Whereas the ip protocol deals only with packets, tcp enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. Tcp takes care of keeping track of the individual units of data called packets. Tcp guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the internet protocol (ip). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as tcp/ip.  Transport layer security tls  Transport layer security (tls) is a protocol that ensures privacy between communicating applications and the users on the internet. When a server and client communicate, tls ensures that no third party may overhear or tamper with any message. Tls is the successor to the secure sockets layer (ssl).  Triple des  Triple des (3des) is the common name for the triple data encryption algorithm (tdea or triple dea) symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the data encryption standard (des) cipher algorithm three times to each data block. It transforms each 64-bit plaintext block by applying the des three successive times, using either two or three different keys, for an effective key length of 112 or 168 bits.  Triple wrapped  Triple wrapped describes any data that has been signed with a digital signature, encrypted, and then signed again is called triple-wrapped.  Trojan horse  A trojan horse is a computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms, sometimes by exploiting legitimate authorization of a system entity that invokes the program.  Trunking  Trunking is a method for a system to provide network access to many clients by sharing a set of lines or frequencies instead of providing them individually. This is analogous to the structure of a tree with one trunk and many branches.  Trust  Trust determines which permissions and what actions other systems or users can perform on remote machines.  Trusted certificate  A trusted certificate is any digital certificate that a certificate user accepts as being valid without testing the certificate to validate it as the final certificate on a certification path; especially a certificate that is used as a trust anchor certificate.  Trusted ports  Trusted ports are ports below number 1024 usually allowed to be opened by the root user.  Tunnel  A tunnel is a communication channel that is created in a computer network by encapsulating a communication protocol’s data packets in a second protocol that normally would be carried above, or at the same layer as, the first one. Most often, a tunnel is a logical point-to-point link created by encapsulating the layer 2 protocol in a transport protocol (such as tcp), in a network or inter-network layer protocol (such as ip), or in another link layer protocol. Tunneling can move data between computers that use a protocol not supported by the network connecting them.

Udp scan  A udp scan performs scans to determine which udp ports are open or vulnerable. Udp is a connectionless protocol so there is no equivalent to a tcp syn packet. However, if a udp packet is sent to a port that is not open, the system will respond with an icmp port unreachable message.  Unicast  Unicast is defined as any communication between a single sender and a single receiver over a network. The term exists in contradiction to multicast, communication between a single sender and multiple receivers, and any cast, communication between any sender and the nearest of a group of receivers in a network.  Uniform resource identifier uri  A uniform resource identifier (uri) is a string of characters that are used to identify the name of a resource. Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network (such as the world wide web) using specific protocols. In other words, uri is the generic term for all types of names and addresses that refer to objects on the world wide web.  Uniform resource locator url  A uniform resource locator (url) is the global address of documents and other resources on the world wide web. The first part of the address indicates what protocol to use, and the second part specifies the ip address or the domain name where the resource is located. A url is a specific type of uniform resource identifier (uri), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. A url implies the means to access an indicated resource, which is not true of every uri. Urls occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (jdbc), and many other applications.  Unix  Unix is a popular multi-user, multi-tasking operating system developed at Bell labs in the early 1970s by ken thompson, dennis ritchie, and others. Unix was designed to be a small, flexible system used exclusively by programmers.  Unprotected share  An unprotected share is a mechanism that allows a user to connect to file systems and printers on other systems. An unprotected share is one that allows anyone to connect to it.  User contingency plan  A user contingency plan is the alternative method of continuing business operations if its systems are unavailable.  User datagram protocol udp  The user datagram protocol (udp) is a communication protocol that, like tcp, runs on top of ip networks. The protocol was designed by david p. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in rfc 768. Udp uses a simple connectionless transmission model with a minimum of protocol mechanism. It is used primarily for broadcasting messages over a network. Udp uses the internet protocol to get a datagram from one computer to another but does not divide a message into packets (datagrams) and reassemble it at the other end. Udp doesn’t provide sequencing of the packets that the data arrives in.  User  A user is any person, organization entity, or automated process that accesses a system, whether authorized to do so or not. Users generally use a system or a software product without the technical expertise required to fully understand it.

Virtual private network vpn  A virtual private network (vpn) extends a private network across a public network, such as the internet. Vpn enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. A vpn is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated connections, virtual tunneling protocols, or traffic encryption. For example, if a corporation has lans at several different sites, each connected to the internet by a firewall, the corporation could create a vpn by (a) using encrypted tunnels to connect from firewall to firewall across the internet and (b) not allowing any other traffic through the firewalls. A vpn is generally less expensive to build and operate than a dedicated real network, because the virtual network shares the cost of system resources with other users of the real network.  Virus  A virus is a hidden, self-replicating section of a computer software or program, usually malicious logic, that propagates by infecting, i.e., inserting a copy of itself into and becoming part of another program. A virus cannot run by itself and requires that its host program be run to make the virus active.  Voice firewall  A voice firewall is a physical discontinuity in a voice network that monitors, alerts, and controls inbound and outbound voice network activity based on user-defined call admission control (cac) policies, voice application layer security threats or unauthorized service use violations.  Voice intrusion prevention system vips  A voice intrusion prevention system (vips) is a security management system for voice networks that monitors voice traffic for multiple calling patterns or attack/abuse signatures to proactively detect and prevent toll fraud, denial of service, telecom attacks, service abuse, and other anomalous activities.

Warchalking  War chalking is marking areas, usually on sidewalks with chalk, that receive wireless signals to advertise an open wi-fi network. Warchalking was inspired by hobo symbols and was conceived by a group of friends in june 2002. They were published by matt jones who designed the set of icons and produced a downloadable document containing them.  War dialer  A war dialer is a computer program that automatically dials a series of telephone numbers to locate lines connected to computer systems, and catalogs those numbers so that a cracker or attacker can try to break into the systems.  War dialing  War dialing is a technique of using a modem to automatically scan a list of telephone numbers, usually dialing every number in a local area code to search for computers, bulletin board systems (computer servers), and fax machines.  Wardriving  Wardriving is searching for wi-fi wireless networks by an individual in a moving vehicle while using a portable computer, smartphone, or personal digital assistant (pda).  Web of trust  The web of trust is a concept that is used in pgp, gnupg, and other openpgp-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner. Its decentralized trust model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority.  Web server  A web server is a computer system that processes requests via http, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the world wide web. Web server is used to refer either the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the http requests.  Whois  A whois is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an internet resource, such as a domain name, an ip address block, or an autonomous system. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable format. The whois protocol is documented in rfc 3912.  Windowing system  A windowing system is a system that is used for sharing a computer’s graphical display presentation resources among multiple applications at the same time. A windowing system uses a window manager to keep track of where each window is located on the display screen and its size and status. A windowing system doesn’t just manage the windows but also other forms of graphical user interface entities.  Windowing  Windowing is the process of taking a small subset of a larger dataset for processing and analysis. In this approach, the rectangular window involves simply truncating the dataset before and after the window, while not modifying the contents of the window at all.  Windump  A windump is a freeware tool for windows that is a protocol analyzer that can monitor network traffic on a wire.  Wired equivalent privacy wep  Wired equivalent privacy (wep) is a security protocol for wireless local area networks defined in the standard ieee 802.11b. It was introduced as part of the original 802.11 standard ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired network. Wep, recognizable by the key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits, was at one time widely in use and was often the first security choice presented to users by router configuration tools.  Wireless application protocol  A wireless application protocol (wap) is a specification for a set of communication protocols to standardize the way that wireless devices, such as cellular telephones and radio transceivers, can be used for internet access, including e-mail, the world wide web, newsgroups, and internet relay chat. A wap browser is a web browser for mobile devices such as mobile phones that uses the protocol.  Wiretapping  Wiretapping is the process of monitoring and recording data that is flowing between two points in a communication system.  World wide web the web www w3  The world wide web (www) is the global, hypermedia-based collection of information and services that is available on internet servers and is accessed by browsers using hypertext transfer protocol and other information retrieval mechanisms.  Worm  A worm is a computer program that can run independently, can propagate a complete working version of itself onto other hosts on a network, and may consume computer resources destructively.

X 400  X.400 was originally published in 1984 by ccitt and later re-written in 1988 jointly by iso and ccitt. X.400 is a standard that conforms to layer 7 of the osi and is a standard used for transporting e-mail messages. X.400 is an alternative standard to the commonly used smtp and includes support for several transport connections including ethernet, tcp/ip, and dial-up.  Xhtml  Xhtml is short for extensible hypertext markup language. Xhtml is a hybrid between xml and html and designed for network devices as a method of displaying web pages on network and portable devices. Xhtml was first released january 26, 2000.  Xml  Xml is short for extensible markup language. Xml is a specification developed by w3c starting with the recommendation on february 10, 1998. Xml is similar to html, xml uses tags to markup a document, allowing the browser to interpret the tags and display them on a page. Unlike html, xml language is unlimited (extensible) which allows self-defining tags and can describe the content instead of only displaying a page’s content. Using xml other languages such as rss and mathml have been created, even tools like xslt were created using xml.  Xmpp  Xmpp which stands for extensible messaging and presence protocol, is a communications protocol for messaging systems. It is based on xml, storing and transmitting data in that format. It is used for sending and receiving instant messages, maintaining buddy lists, and broadcasting the status of one’s online presence. Xmpp is an open protocol standard. Anyone can operate their own xmpp service, and use it to interact with any other xmpp service. The standard is maintained by xsf, the xmpp standards foundation.  Xmt  Xmt is also called transmit. Xmt is the method of sending data to an alternate computer or device.  Xns  Xns is short for xerox network services, xns is a proprietary network communications protocol developed by xerox. Xns is no longer used and has been replaced by transmission control protocol / interface program (tcp/ip).

Y2k  Y2k is short for the year 2000 bug or the millennium bug. Y2k is a warning first published by bob bemer in 1971 describing the issues of computers using a two-digit year date stamp.  Ymodem  A ymodem is a file-transfer protocol developed by Chuck Forsburg, that is similar to the enhanced 1k version of xmodem. Ymodem sends data in 1024-byte blocks, allows for multiple file transmissions at once, performs cyclic redundancy checks (crc), and can reduce the transfer size to compensate for poor connections.  Yottabyte  Yottabyte is abbreviated as yb. A yottabyte is equal to 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 (280) bits, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1024) bytes and is the largest recognized value used with storage.

Zero day attack  A zero-day (or zero-hour or day zero) attack is a computer threat that attempts to manipulate the computer application vulnerabilities that are undisclosed to the software developer. Zero-day exploits is the actual code that can use a security hole to carry out an attack. These exploits are used or shared by attackers before the software developer knows about the vulnerability.  Zero day  The zero day or day zero is the day a new vulnerability is made known. In some cases, a zero day exploit is referred to an exploit for which no patch is available yet. Day one is a day at which the patch is made available.  Zombies  A zombie computer is a computer connected to the internet that has been compromised by a hacker, a computer virus, or a trojan horse. Generally, a compromised machine is only one of many in a botnet, and is used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.
