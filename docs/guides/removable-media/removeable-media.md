## Removable Media (USB, CDs, Network Storage)

### Removable Media

Removable media (such as USB drives) grants us the ability to store and transfer large volumes of sensitive data on the fly. In doing so, we often neglect a range of security risks.  
  
It is vital that you manage the following risks associated with your use of removable media:

- **Information Loss:** Removable media can be lost quite easily. This can compromise a large portion of the confidential information that is stored on them. Some types of media will even retain data after deletion, which adds additional risk if the media is used between different systems (or if they are disposed of).
    
- **Malware Introduction:** The unrestrained use of removable media can increase the risk of introducing malware into your information systems.
    
- **Damage of Reputation:** Lost removable media can result in damage to your company's reputation, even if no specific data loss has occurred.
    

We recommend that you share our Removable Media Guide among your employees & colleagues, and that you promote safe removable media behaviour in your organisation.
