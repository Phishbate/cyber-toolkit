**What you need to do**

Understand exactly what types of important information you have in your business and where it is located. Examples of storage locations include:

- USB drives  
- emails  
- computers / mobile devices  
- cloud based solutions such as Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive.

To determine types of important information in your business and locations, you could request this information by:

- conducting a survey with all staff  
- having a face-to-face meeting with all staff  
- sending an email to all staff  
- all of the above, depending on whatâ€™s practical for your business.

When you know where you currently have your important information, you can then collate it in central locations. 

Spend some time securing all your important information:

- Ensure you have secure storage methods for your information. These could include encryption and /or restricting access by managing user account privileges
- Limit storage locations so you can keep track of your information  
- Make sure staff know where and how to securely store important information  
- Restrict access to only those staff who need it to do their job  
- Encrypt important information on laptops, mobile devices and external hard drives  
- Store hard copies of important information securely in a locked drawer or locked filing cabinet Implement a secure way of sharing confidential or sensitive information

Most modern Android and iPhone mobile devices have encryption enabled by default if you have a strong PIN or password. Check your device settings to make sure.

**Why is this important?**

Your sensitive information could be of potential value to cyber attackers. Examples of this could be:

- customer details or other personal information 
- employee details
- bank account details, credit card numbers or other payment related information
- intellectual property  
- contracts or sales related information.

Make sure you store sensitive information securely to limit the potential of anyone accessing or modifying it without your authorisation. A leak of important information could expose your business, customers or partners to significant harm. This may include potential financial loss, reputational damage and regulatory penalties.
