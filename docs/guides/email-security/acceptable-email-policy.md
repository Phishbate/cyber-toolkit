## Acceptable Email Usage Policy
### Email Usage Policy

We live in an age of fast-paced communications fueled by the latest technologies. Email is the most commonly used communication medium in businesses. However company emails contain private information and the rise in cyber crimes has introduced many problems and threats. Therefore it is important to ensure that only the intended recipients have access to the information. The distribution of an acceptable email usage guide can assist you in minimizing some of these security risks.

We believe that a comprehensive email policy will help your employees understand your expectations regarding the use of company email. You can also specify best practices regarding the use of company devices and employee-owned devices used for work.

We recommend that you share our Email Usage Guide with all your management and staff, and also implement the same in accordance with your company's cyber security framework.
