##### What you need to do

While it may not always be practical to negotiate individual contracts with cloud service providers, you can still check:

- **Security certifications** – do they have accreditations to cyber security standards such ISO 27001, Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard?
- **Terms of service** – which will often include cyber security measures they take and what responsibilities they expect your business to take. Make sure you are comfortable with these stipulations. If you aren't sure, speak to your legal advisers for guidance.

If you can negotiate the terms of their engagement with your business, you should ensure to cover cyber security matters. Specify and make clear the respective responsibilities of both parties.

Consider including terms to cover the following:

- Adherence to your security requirements or an industry security benchmark
- Security breach notification requirements and what remedial action they will take to address any potential breaches
- Right to audit and test the security measures the third party has in place
- Management of supply chain risks with the same security requirements
- Communication of changes.

Ultimately, the clauses that should go into a contract with a third party is a legal question so always consult with your legal advisers.

##### Why is this important?

All relationships you have with third party suppliers and/or vendors should have a formal legal agreement. It should include how they will apply security measures to protect your systems and/or information which they will have access. This is especially important if they have access to sensitive information. A security breach involving any of these suppliers can have significant negative consequences for your business.
