# Summary

90% of breaches are successful due to a human error. This is the biggest problem in cyber security right now.

The problem exists because organizations fall into one of two buckets:

1/ they provide no awareness training to staff

2/ the training they do provide sucks

Cyber Aware fixes both. We automate the enrollment of staff and deliver highly engaging training tailored to each individuals risk profile.

We partner with MSP, MSSP, IT service providers and consulting firms to offer a white-label Security Awareness Platform. Partners can deliver industry-leading phishing and training automatically on auto-pilot.
