### Patch Management

Online threats are constantly evolving and so your company's cyber defense systems must be continuously updated. It is dangerous to have your core technical resources in operation without the latest security updates for effective protection. A patch is basically an update to an existing software to either fix a vulnerability or further improve its operation. Patch management governs the knowledge and application of all the latest software updates, and the testing and documentation of your company's systems after each update. It is vital to be proactive in maintaining and enhancing your organisation's cyber security mechanisms.

Generally patch management is conducted by your internal IT support or external IT vendor. We strongly recommend that you contact the relevant party and ask them to confirm that all of the following details are correct:

- We have an inventory of all devices and the software installed on them.
- We have a patch management plan.
- We apply all available patches within 30 days of them being released.
- We are first testing patches in a sandbox type environment.
- Notifications are sent when new versions / patches are available.
- When supported by an application, automatic upgrade / patching is enabled.
- If a patch can not be applied, then management is notified.
