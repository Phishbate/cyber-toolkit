# Limit access to your devices, systems and applications.md

##### What you need to do

- Provide internal staff and external suppliers, contractors and consultants their own, individual accounts. Only provide them access to those systems and applications they need to get their work done
- Review who has access to your devices, systems and applications on a regular basis and whether they still need that access
- Limit administrator accounts to only those staff who need them. Allocate regular accounts to everyone for day-to-work
- Only use administrator access yourself for specific accounts and only when you need to

##### Helpful guidance

##### Why is this important?

You need to have processes in place to regulate who will have access to devices, software, applications. This applies not just for internal staff but also external suppliers, contractors and consultants.

It will help to minimise the risk of unauthorised access to your IT environment and important information.
