# Website Scan

**Website Compliance Robot**

---

## 1. **Website Security**

1.1 **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) not enforced**

Without HSTS enforced, people browsing this site are more susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. The server should be configured to support HSTS.

1.2 **HttpOnly cookies not used**

When HttpOnly cookies are not used, the cookies can be accessed on the client, which enables certain type of client-side attacks. The website configuration should be changed to enforce HttpOnly cookies.

1.3 **X-Frame-Options is not deny or sameorigin**

Browsers may display this website's content in frames. This can lead to clickjacking attacks.

1.4 **CSP is not implemented**

No valid Content Security Policy is implemented. This increases the risk of XSS and clickjacking attacks.

1.5 **Domain was not found on the HSTS preload list**

The domain was not found on the HSTS preload list. Users who visit the website for the first time will be vulnerable to MITM attacks. The requirements for inclusion on the preload list are specified by hstspreload.org.

1.6 **X-Content-Type-Options is not nosniff**

Browsers may interpret files as a different MIME type than what is specified in the Content-Type HTTP header. This can lead to MIME confusion attacks.

1.7 **Weak cipher suites supported in TLS 1.2**

Weak cipher suites can potentially be broken by a well resourced attacker, and should not be supported by the server unless very old devices or browsers must be supported.

**1.8 No insecure SSL/TLS versions [available]**

No insecure SSL/TLS versions are available for this site.

**1.9 CAA enabled**

The domain contains a valid Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) record. A CAA record indicates which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are authorized to issue certificates for a domain.

1.10 **Not vulnerable to CVE-2015-4000 (Logjam)**

The server is using strong Diffie-Hellman parameters and is not vulnerable to the Logjam attack.

1.11 **Not vulnerable to CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed)**

A bug in OpenSSL's implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension allows access to portions of memory on the targeted host e.g. cryptographic keys and passwords.

1.12 **Not vulnerable to CVE-2014-3566 (POODLE)**

The server does not support SSLv3, and is not vulnerable to the POODLE attack.

1.13 **Not vulnerable to CVE-2015-0204 (FREAK)**

The server does not offer RSA_EXPORT cipher suites, so clients are not vulnerable to the FREAK attack.

1.14 **SSL does not expire within 20 days**

SSL certificate does not expire within 20 days.

1.15 **SSL expiration period shorter than 398 days**

The SSL certificate presented by the server has an expiration period shorter than 398 days.

1.16 **SSL has not expired**

SSL certificate has not expired.

```jsx
import ssl
import socket
from datetime import datetime

def check_ssl_certificate_expiration(hostname, port=443):
    try:
        context = ssl.create_default_context()
        with socket.create_connection((hostname, port)) as sock:
            with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=hostname) as ssl_sock:
                cert = ssl_sock.getpeercert()
                expiration_date = datetime.strptime(cert['notAfter'], "%b %d %H:%M:%S %Y %Z")
                current_date = datetime.now()
                days_left = (expiration_date - current_date).days
                if days_left > 0:
                    print(f"The SSL certificate for {hostname} is valid. {days_left} days left.")
                else:
                    print(f"The SSL certificate for {hostname} has expired.")
    except ssl.SSLError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while checking the SSL certificate: {e}")
    except socket.gaierror as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while connecting to the server: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
website = "example.com"
check_ssl_certificate_expiration(website)
```

1.17 **Strong SSL algorithm**

Industry standard SHA-256 encryption in use.

/cod

1.18 **Hostname matches SSL certificate**

The site's hostname matches the SSL certificate.

1.19 **Certificate not found on our revoked certificate list**

The site's certificate chain was checked against our list of revoked certificates.

1.20 **SSL certificate chain present in server response**

A complete SSL certificate chain was presented by the server for this domain.

1.21 **SSL chain certificates do not expire within 20 days**

SSL intermediate and root certificates do not expire within 20 days.

1.22 **Trusted SSL certificate**

The certificate presented by this domain was issued by a trusted certificate authority.

```python
import requests
import certifi

def check_certificate_trust(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, verify=certifi.where())
        return response.status_code == requests.codes.ok
    except requests.exceptions.SSLError:
        return False

# Example usage
website_url = "https://example.com"
is_trusted = check_certificate_trust(website_url)
if is_trusted:
    print("The certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority.")
else:
    print("The certificate is not issued by a trusted certificate authority.")
```

1.23 **Strong public certificate key length**

The site's public certificate provides at least 112 bits of security strength.

1.24 **SSL available**

SSL is supported for this site.

1.25 **HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS**

All HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.

```jsx
import requests

def check_redirect_to_https(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=False)
        if response.status_code == 301 or response.status_code == 302:
            redirect_url = response.headers.get('Location')
            if redirect_url.startswith('https://'):
                print(f"The website '{url}' redirects to HTTPS.")
            else:
                print(f"The website '{url}' does not redirect to HTTPS.")
        else:
            print(f"The website '{url}' does not redirect to HTTPS.")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
check_redirect_to_https('http://example.com')
```

1.26 **X-Powered-By header not exposed**

Information about specific technology used on the server is obscured.

1.27 **HSTS header contains includeSubDomains**

The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header contains the includeSubDomains directive.

1.28 **ASP.NET version header not exposed**

Ensuring the ASP.NET version header is not exposed makes it harder for attackers to exploit certain vulnerabilities.

1.29 **ASP.NET version header not exposing specific ASP.net version**

Ensuring the ASP.NET version header is not exposing a specific version makes it harder for attackers to exploit certain vulnerabilities.

```python
import requests

def check_aspnet_version_exposure(url, target_version):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        version_header = response.headers.get('X-AspNet-Version')
        if version_header:
            if target_version in version_header:
                print(f"The website is exposing the ASP.NET version: {version_header}")
                print("This version may be vulnerable to attacks.")
            else:
                print(f"The website is using ASP.NET, but not exposing the specified version.")
                print(f"The ASP.NET version header: {version_header}")
        else:
            print("The website is not using ASP.NET or does not have an ASP.NET version header.")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Usage example
url = 'https://example.com'
target_version = '4.7.2'
check_aspnet_version_exposure(url, target_version)
```

1.30 **Secure cookies used**

Using secure cookies reduces the risk of third parties intercepting information contained in these cookies.

```python
import requests

def check_secure_cookies(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        cookies = response.cookies
        secure_cookies = [cookie for cookie in cookies if cookie.secure]

        if secure_cookies:
            print("The website is using secure cookies.")
        else:
            print("The website is not using secure cookies.")

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print("An error occurred:", str(e))

# Example usage
website_url = "https://example.com"
check_secure_cookies(website_url)
```

1.31 **Server information header not exposed**

Ensuring the server information header is not exposed reduces the ability of attackers to exploit certain vulnerabilities.

1.32 **Referrer Policy is not unsafe-url**

The website's Referrer Policy is not configured to allow unsafe information to be sent in the referrer header.

1.33 **Domain index is not a listable directory**

The domain index is not a listable directory.

1.34 **No unmaintained page detected**

The page appears to be maintained.

1.35 **No open cloud storage service detected**

No cloud storage service configured to allow anonymous file listing was detected.

## 2. **Email Security**

2.1 **SPF syntax correct**

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record passes basic syntax checks.

```python
import dns.resolver

def has_spf_record(domain):
    try:
        answers = dns.resolver.resolve(domain, 'TXT')
        for rdata in answers:
            if 'v=spf1' in rdata.strings:
                return True
    except dns.resolver.NXDOMAIN:
        return False
    return False

def passes_syntax_checks(domain):
    try:
        answers = dns.resolver.resolve(domain, 'TXT')
        for rdata in answers:
            if 'v=spf1' in rdata.strings:
                spf_record = ''.join(rdata.strings)
                # Basic syntax check
                if spf_record.startswith('v=spf1 ') and ' ' in spf_record:
                    return True
    except dns.resolver.NXDOMAIN:
        return False
    return False

# Example usage
domain = 'example.com'

if has_spf_record(domain):
    print(f"The domain {domain} has an SPF record.")
else:
    print(f"The domain {domain} does not have an SPF record.")

if passes_syntax_checks(domain):
    print(f"The SPF record for {domain} passes basic syntax checks.")
else:
    print(f"The SPF record for {domain} does not pass basic syntax checks.")
```

2.2 **Strict SPF filtering**

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record strictly enforces specific domains allowed to send email on its behalf.

2.3 **SPF ptr mechanism not used**

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record does not include the ptr mechanism.

2.4 **DMARC policy exists**

DMARC protects against fraudulent emails being sent from a domain.

```python
import requests
import re

def check_dmarc_policy(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        html_content = response.text

        # Regular expression pattern to find the DMARC policy in the HTML content
        dmarc_pattern = r"(DMARC[^<]+)"

        # Search for the DMARC policy in the HTML content
        matches = re.search(dmarc_pattern, html_content, re.IGNORECASE)
        if matches:
            dmarc_policy = matches.group(0)
            return f"The website contains a DMARC policy:\n{dmarc_policy}"
        else:
            return "The website does not contain a DMARC policy."
    else:
        return "Failed to fetch the website content."

# Example usage
website_url = "https://www.example.com"
result = check_dmarc_policy(website_url)
print(result)
```

2.5 **DMARC policy is p=reject**

DMARC reject policy provides the most effective protection against fraudulent emails being sent from a domain.

```python

```

2.6 **DMARC policy percentage is default**

DMARC policy percentage is set to default 100%, ensuring all mail is covered by the policy.

2.7 **No unregistered MX records detected**

No unregistered MX records that could lead to receiving mail on behalf of the target organization were detected.

## 3. **Network Security**

3.1 **DNSSEC not enabled**

DNSSEC records prevent third parties from forging the records that guarantee a domain's identity. DNSSEC should be configured for this domain.

3.2 **No ports are open**

No open ports were detected.
