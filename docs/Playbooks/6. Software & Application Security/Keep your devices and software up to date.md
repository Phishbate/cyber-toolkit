#Action-Now 

What you need to do
- Apply updates as soon as they are available
- Enable automatic updates on software, operating systems, application and devices where they are available
- Allocate responsibility to someone in your business or an external person/provider to apply updates on a regular basis
- Replace devices and upgrade software to the latest versions if they are no longer supported by the product manufacturer/developer
- Set a convenient time for auto-updates  
- Ensure your antivirus software has auto-updates turned on  
- Check and install auto-updates manually for any software that doesnâ€™t have auto-updates available

**Helpful guidance**
The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides detailed guidance and step-by-step instructions to help you understand and implement recommended actions:

**Why is this important?**
Out of date and vulnerable software, operating systems, applications and devices are involved in almost all security breaches. 

Devices and software that are out of date can enable cyber attackers to:

- gain access to and steal sensitive information stored on your devices  
- infect those devices with malicious software  
- interfere with your business' productivity by preventing those devices running smoothly (or stopping them working completely).
