# Implement Two-Factor Authentication
### What is Two-Factor Authentication?

Simply put, two-factor authentication (or 2FA) is a two-step or two-layer verification system. It requires the user to provide two categories of information to prove that they are the legitimate account holders. These two categories of information can be derived from any combination of the following three sources:

- User-specific knowledge (PIN, password, secret)
- User-owned material (cell phone, other mobile devices)
- User's bio characteristics (facial recognition, retina scan, fingerprint)

The 2FA can be compared to single-factor authentication (SFA), where there is one verification level wherein the user only provides a password.

### What does this look like in practice?

Typically, email, website or system logins require only a username and a password. Realistically, it is not extremely difficult for a cyber criminal to elicit this information and gain direct access to your login.  
  
This is where two-factor authentication comes in. After the username and password for a login is entered, two-factor will require a unique code from a third-party app or contact to confirm that the login is valid.

This way, a cyber criminal would require both your username, password and access to your two-factor system in order to successfully compromise a system.

A common example of two-factor is when your bank sends through an SMS code to confirm an online purchase or exchange. Another example is when Social Media sites require a unique SMS code when logging in from a new device.

### Why is Two-Factor Authentication Important?

Most of a company's resources are in digital form and archived on computer systems. This information is viewed as a valuable target by cyber criminals. According to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, cybercrime costs the Australian economy an annual one billion AUD in direct costs alone.

It is important to do all that we can to secure our digital assets and ensure that we donâ€™t become a part of the statistics. The two-factor authentication process presents an additional obstacle for hackers trying to gain access to online accounts, and it can make the difference between a major cyber-incident occurring through your login.  
  
Two-Factor Authentication provides an extra layer of reinforcement to our customary password-only approach that is as essential as seatbelts are to road safety.
