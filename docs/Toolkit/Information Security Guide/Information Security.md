### Information Security
Data is one of the core resources of any business. One of the vital steps in securing your data is to first classify it. Each organisation will own a variety of data resources according to the various business process areas within the organisation. After this classification process is completed, a clear and concise information protection policy must be distributed to all employees.

The general rule of thumb is that the more confidential the data is, the more stringent and restrictive access to it should be. Access to data in an organisation must be on a need-to-know basis: select individuals should have access to select data.

As a starting point, we recommend that you read the suggested list of confidential data in our  **Information Security Guide**. Just as the “Crown Jewels” in this guide are all catalogued according to a distinct set of criteria, we recommend performing a review and compiling a classified list of your own company's data.

Once you have created your own list of confidential company data, we further recommend that you circulate our  **Information Security Guide** to educate your staff on how this classified data should be handled. Finally, it’s also crucial to periodically remind your staff about the best practices in managing sensitive information.
