# How it Works

1. You sign up with us
2. Let us know who your employees are
3. We’ll send a dynamic, targeted phishing campaign to your employees
4. We’ll measure
    1. How many emails are sent
    2. Who reported it
    3. Who opened
    4. Who clicked
    5. And ultimately who entered their username and password (and got Phished). 
        1. We never store users credentials
        2. We will pop-up a site to notify the employee that they have been Phished and include a ‘Just In Time’ Phishing Awareness micro-learning module (1-5 minutes)
5. At the end of every Phishing campaign (after a designated time period) we will generate and send you a report which identifies all of the above for you
6. We can automatically send your team members who get to steps c, d and e and put them onto Phishing Awareness Training
