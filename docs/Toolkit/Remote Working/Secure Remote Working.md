### Securing Remote Workers

In this era of digital communication, and especially moving into the new decade, working remotely has quickly become a viable alternative to the conventional workplace.

While there are several benefits to employees and employers that come with working remotely, the decentralised nature of the virtual workspace reveals risks that need to be accounted for and managed.

It is extremely important that remote employees are fully compliant in following company guidelines, and working in consideration of secure access, appropriate data management, and strictly within your company's information system.

We recommend that you distribute our Cyber Aware Secure Remote Working Guide to all remote workers in order to ensure that their work environment meets the minimum cyber security requirements.

We also highly recommend that you contact your IT manager, service provider or relevant member of staff to ensure that a VPN connection is implemented for all remote access.
