#Action-Later 

**What you need to do**

In order to effectively secure portable devices in your business, there are two steps.  
Firstly, you need to understand which measures you need to action. Key measures to secure portable devices include:

- **Encryption** – enable device encryption if you're storing or accessing important business information on portable devices. This ensures the information can't be accessed by someone else without your permission, even if you lose it.
- **Updates** – use the automatic update feature to install application and operating system updates on portable devices as soon as they're available. Apps should only be installed from official device application stores.
- **Unlocking** – enforce the use of a strong password, PIN, gesture or fingerprint to unlock portable devices. Ensure devices are set to automatically lock when not in use. Information could be compromised on devices that are not locked, if those devices are lost.
- **Remote locking** – enable remote locking and/or wiping functions (if supported). If a portable device is lost these functions can help reduce the risk of information being compromised.
- **Security software** – install reputable security software that includes antivirus and anti-theft/loss protection. Your device's retailer or service provider can provide recommendations.
- **Passwords** – set the device to require a password before anyone tries to install applications. This will prevent unauthorised modifications to the device.

Secondly, it's important to consider what actions you can take to put into place security measures on all your portable devices. What will be practical from a time, efficiency and cost perspective will depend on your business. Some options are outlined below:

- Educate staff – educate your staff about how to securely configure their portable devices and then ask them to do it themselves. The downside of this approach is that there is no guarantee your staff will configure devices correctly.
- Manual device security – you may wish to set up device security before providing them to staff. You can either do this yourself or engage the services of an external IT expert. The advantage of this approach is the confidence devices are set up securely before staff start to use them.
- Central tool – a centralised tool may be a more practical way of enforcing secure configuration settings. It can help ensure your devices are configured securely on an ongoing basis. To help with this process you may wish to engage the services of an external IT expert.

**Why is this important?**

Most businesses rely on some portable devices such as laptops, mobile phones and tablets for work purposes. These devices are often used to access, store and process important business information. Portable devices are not always set up with the most secure settings as a default by the manufacturer. You will need to set them up securely to minimise the risk of a cyber incident.
