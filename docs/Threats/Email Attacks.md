In addition to scams like phishing, a common email attack against small businesses is **business email compromise (BEC)**. Criminals can impersonate business representatives by using compromised email accounts, or through other means – like using a domain name that looks similar to a real business. Aside from stealing information, the goal of these attacks is usually to scam victims into sending funds to a bank account operated by the scammer.

#### Ways to mitigate

The best defence against email attacks is training and awareness for your employees. Ensure your staff know to always be cautious of emails with the following:

- requests for payments, especially if urgent or overdue
- change of bank details
- an email address that doesn't look quite right, such as the domain name not exactly matching the supplier's company name.

While these attacks can be devastating, the mitigation measures are easy and cost almost nothing. **When staff receive emails like this, the most effective mitigation is to call the sender to confirm they are legitimate.**Do not use the contact details you have been sent as these could be fraudulent. Introduce a formal process for staff to follow when payment requests are received or bank details are changed.

### Case study

A small construction business received an email from their supplier saying they had changed banks. The supplier provided new account details for invoice payments. Because the email seemed legitimate, **the construction business did not call the supplier to confirm the change in bank account details.**

The business paid an invoice from the supplier for over $70,000. The following day, another employee mistakenly paid the same invoice again for an additional amount over $70,000. In total, over $150,000 was paid to the new bank account.

When the business rang their supplier to ask if they could refund the duplicate payment, the supplier advised those banking details were incorrect. An investigation was launched immediately, and the supplier discovered that one of their email accounts had been hacked and was sending out fraudulent bank account details. **No funds were recovered.**
