# Web Filtering
### Enable Website Filtering

The application of cyber security best practices is the responsibility of every member of your organisation. However, we all make mistakes. A very common mistake is when a team-member clicks on an unassuming link, which then takes them to a harmful or inappropriate website.

This may appear as a mild security incident upon first glance, but it's these kinds of mistakes that have levelled systems and compromised the entire corporation's worth of data to the hands of cyber criminals.

We recommend that you set up website filtering so that you can effectively protect your business. Your IT manager / vendor will be able to assist you in configuring this process via a proxy or firewall. It is also the case that some anti-virus platforms also possess web filtering capabilities.

We recommend that you block the following general categories:

- Adult/Sexually Explicit Material
- Chat and Instant Messaging
- Gambling
- Hacking
- Illegal Drugs
- Intimate Apparel and Swimwear
- Peer to Peer File Sharing
- Personals and Dating
- Social Network Services
- SPAM, Phishing and Fraud
- Spyware
- Violence, Intolerance and Hate
- Web Based Email

This list is by no means exhaustive and should only serve as a general guide. Your company's web filtering is also dependent on the environment in which the process is being applied.
