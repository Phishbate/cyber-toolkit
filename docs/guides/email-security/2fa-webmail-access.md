# Two-Factor Webmail Access

It is extremely important to ensure that your company's webmail is secure. This is the system that is responsible for transmitting all email communications, which frequently contain valuable and sensitive information about your business operations.  
  
Cyber criminals frequently illicit huge financial damages via unauthorised access to webmail. It's a vital and often under-protected resource that all organisations need to protect.

So how do you secure your organisation's webmail? A key security measure on any system, including webmail, is to enable two-factor authentication on logins. Furthermore, access can often be restricted based on IP Address Ranges or geographical location to ensure that all logins are ones that you're aware of and approve of. All webmail providers should support two-factor authentication and location-based access control.

If you cannot enable the two-factor functionality for your webmail, we recommend that you consider disabling webmail access for all staff.

We also highly recommend that you contact your webmail provider with instructions to force two-factor authentication for all webmail access logins.
