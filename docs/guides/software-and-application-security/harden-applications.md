## Common Application Hardening

There are countless cyber threats to the security and effective operation of your company's information systems. Your workstations are often the targets of online criminals who seek to use a number of methods to illegally access, modify and steal your data, or otherwise disrupt your business processes.

Therefore it is important to make the applications on your workstations resilient to cyber attacks through “hardening”. Hardening refers to proactively re-configuring your software/applications for the purpose of enhancing your security.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- User access control measures
    
- Restricted application features
    
- Restricted cross-platform intergrations / plugins
    
- Restricted access from the software to your operating system or other integrations
