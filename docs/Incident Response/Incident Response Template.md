### Incident Response

What should you do if a cyber security breach occurs? Apart from executing your company's internal incident response procedures, in some instances you are also legally required to notify all affected parties.

Just as a comprehensive internal incident response policy is important, we recommend that you also have a standardized breach notification letter on file. When we are in crisis mode, it is always reassuring to have templates already created so that they can be easily adjusted to fit the current needs.

We recommend that you peruse our Breach Notification Letter template. This notification letter template would be used to notify affected individuals about a data security breach within your organisation that involves their personal information. We have also added integrated notes containing essential explanations and drafting tips.

We strongly recommend that you obtain legal counsel to assist in the final draft of your company's breach notification letter and the actual breach notification process.
