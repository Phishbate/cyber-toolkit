### Disable Auto-Play for Removable Media

The majority of removable media has an auto-run feature that can be exploited to execute viruses. By simply plugging in an infected device, removable media can immediately execute viruses within your operating system. As such, we recommend that the autoplay feature is disabled by default for all removable media in the organisation.

If you are operating on Windows, we strongly recommend the following changes to your settings so that removable devices do not autorun. Please see the following steps:

- Go to  **Start** >  **Settings** >  **Devices.**
    
- Click  **AutoPlay** in the pane on the left.
    
- **Choose** the default action when a removable drive is plugged in to your computer.
    
- **Choose** the default action when a memory card is plugged in to your computer.
    

You can also change your autoplay options from the Control Panel:

- Right-click the "Start" button.
    
- Open the  **Control Panel**.
    
- Go to  **Programs** >  **Default Programs** > Change  **AutoPlay Settings**.
    
- Select "Take No Action" for all the removable media (such as DVD, CD and USB drives) that you insert, and for all other types of devices that you may connect.
