# Passwords

## Here are some tips on how to ensure you have a safe password:

- Choose passwords that have numbers mixed with upper and lower case letters.
- Never use 'easy to guess' passwords such as: your date of birth consecutive numbers, a series of the same number, a sequence from the associated account number, historically significant dates, your driver's license number, an alphabetical code that is recognisable part of your name, our phone number or part thereof.
- Don't share your passwords with anyone.
- Setup two-factor authentication for an extra layer of defense.
- You can use touch ID or finger scanning technology for mobile device security.

Always forgetting your passwords? Try a password manager! They are a great way to securely hold all of your passwords while only having to remember one.

Another option is to create a tiered password system.  This allows you to identify high and low risk areas. High risk areas might include things like financial website, online banking paymens and social media.  Low risk areas might enclude newletters and non-confidential infromation.  This alows you to create complex passwords for high risk areas and and less complex passwords for your low risk areas.
