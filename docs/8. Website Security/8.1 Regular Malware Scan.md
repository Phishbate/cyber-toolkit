### Enable regular website malware scans

Most businesses underestimate the damage a cyber hacker can inflict on your website, and consequently to your business. If your website is left unprotected, cyber hackers have the power to steal sensitive information (such as credit card details), insert malware, modify your website copy and obtain passwords.

Cyber attacks are a global problem that you need to be prepared for on all fronts. Chances are at some stage, your website will suffer from a cyber-attack. And, unfortunately, most website hosting providers do not provide the coverage required for a full-service recovery and security review.

If you accept any form of payment via your website or if you have a client / partner login function, we highly recommend you implement SiteGuard to provide a level of security for your website.

Site Guard Protect scans your website daily for sign of malware, and if any is found, automatically removes the malicious code/malware detected. In addition, they check whether your domain name is blacklisted with Google or currently appearing on any mailing blacklists.
