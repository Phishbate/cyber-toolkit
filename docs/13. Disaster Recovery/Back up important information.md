**What you need to do**

Understand where you store important information in your business. You can't back up your important information if you don't know where it resides

Select a backup method that works for your business. Choose either an external storage device or cloud service, depending on your business size and requirements

- Decide where to store external devices if you use them to back up  
- Restrict backups access to only staff who need it to do their jobs  
- Backup important information regularly  
- Carefully store and manage access to your backups so that it is secure  
- Check any existing important data already stored with a cloud service provider (eg Office 365) has backups
