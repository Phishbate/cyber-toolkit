# Safe Internet Browsing

## Here are some tips to help make sure you are browsing the internet safely and securely:

- Make sure your mobile operating system and desktop and mobile web browsers are up-to-date. This can be easily done by enabling automatic updates.
- Before entering any personal information onto a site, at the very least ensure that the site is secure by checking that the URL begins with 'https' instead of 'http'. The 's' stands for secure!
- The safest way to visit a website is by entering in the URL yourself and saving it as a bookmark.
- Always use a unique and challenging password when logging on to a website. For more information on what makes a strong password or how to manage a large number of unique passwords, click [here](https://suncorpgroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Security/SitePages/Password-Best-Practice.aspx) or check out the Password Best Practice page in the Security Awareness Hub[](http://intranet.ourspace.int.corp.sun/services/Pages/Passwords.aspx).
- Beware of malicious advertisements, especially when attempting to download files.
- Be aware of current online scams and avoid downloading or clicking links that are not from trusted sources. Check out the [ACCC's Little Black Book of Scams](https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/the-little-black-book-of-scams) to stay up-to-date on scams
- If something seems suspicious, don't click it!
- When at home and you feel you have been a victim of cybercrime, report it to the [Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN)](https://report.acorn.gov.au/) or [Consumer Protection](https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/get-guidance/scamwatch/) in New Zealand
