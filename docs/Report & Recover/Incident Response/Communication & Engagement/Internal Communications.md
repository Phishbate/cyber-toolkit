Beyond the regular situation reports, it may be necessary to brief employees of your organisation about a cyber incident. This is important if organisational IT networks, systems or applications no longer operate as expected, or if the situation has potential to generate media or public interest.

Key messages to consider when communicating with employees Â include:

- What happened and why did it happen?
- What will happen in the immediate future?
- What are employees expected to do?
- Who can employees contact if they have questions?

All internal communications must be reviewed and approved by <communications lead and the Incident Manager> prior to release.|
