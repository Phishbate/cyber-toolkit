It is likely that your organisation will use a Local Area Network (LAN) to connect your computers in the workplace. As with all digital communication media, security is paramount. There are several settings and processes that you can implement to significantly boost the cyber resilience of your company's network.

Please see our recommended checklist of secure network settings below:

- Ensure there is a firewall active and configured as the perimeter protection of your network(s).
    
- Configure your routers to "deny" as the default.
    
- Change the default passwords for all network devices (eg: routers, switches, firewalls).
    
- Disable unused services and ports on network equipment.
    
- Enable server / firewall logs and store them for a minimum of 2 months.
    
- Disable remote management of servers ( **connect via a VPN**).
    
- Enforce all remote connections via a VPN.
    
- For the administration of servers, use a network that is (logically) separated from the user network.
    
- Implement a basic alerting process when unusual network activity is detected.
    
- Document and maintain a log of users who have access to networking components.
    
- Do a regular audit of attached devices on the network and ensure that they are all known devices.
    

  

We also recommend that you share our Cyber Aware Secure WiFi Checklist with your IT manager, service provider, or person(s) responsible for workplace WiFi, and ensure that each point is implemented. Below is a template for sharing the resource and opening up the conversation:

_Hi [name].   
We are currently undergoing a cyber security review and have been provided the following checklist for our internal network. Can you please provide details around which of these requirements is not yet implemented and the process to have them implemented ASAP._
