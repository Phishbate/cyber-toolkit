## How to clean up your inbox in three steps

### Easily unsubscribe from emails

See all your subscription emails in one list and opt-out easily.

Simply choose the ones that you no longer want and we do the hard work of unsubscribing you from them.[Start unsubscribing](https://leavemealone.app/signup)

### Rollup your favorite newsletters

After you've finished opting-out of emails we can combine your remaining newsletters into email digests.

We'll collect these emails and deliver on your schedule, daily or weekly.

### Block everything else

Screen out the marketing spam, unwanted newsletters, and cold-emails by only allowing senders you trust into your Inbox.

### Plus many more features for managing your inbox

Once you've mass-unsubscribed from all your unwanted emails, our **[Rollups](https://leavemealone.app/rollups) and [Shield](https://leavemealone.app/shield) features** will help you to keep your inbox clean with a minimal amount of effort!

- We follow unsubscribe links and **actually unsubscribe** you from emails. You'll never receive them again, even if you stop using our service.
- You can connect **as many email accounts as you like** and see all your subscription emails together in a single place. No more tab switching!
- You can categorize your emails into **up to 10 Rollups**. These digests can be sent either daily or weekly on your custom schedule.
- Tired of fake personal emails trying to sell you something? We'll **block cold emails** sent via mass-mailer tools from landing in your inbox.
- You want to receive some **important emails immediately**. Mark emails as priority senders and they will always arrive in your inbox.
- Need time to focus? Our **do-not-disturb mode** holds onto your emails and delivers them when your focus time has finished.

### Secure & Private

We take your privacy seriously. Your emails are just that - yours, and they should stay that way.

We are proud to be open and transparent about the data we have access to and what we use it for.

### Come see what the fuss is about

Leave Me Alone helped me easily unsubscribe and brought a lot of relief to my life. Email shouldn't feel like you're being harassed and most companies make it hard to unsubscribe. Being able to see it all in one place, just one click away is amazing. More products should be like this and care about your privacy, empower you to take back your inbox, and put the user first!

Leave Me Alone has helped me tremendously in getting ALL of my inboxes out of the clutterbox that they were. This tool is so incredibly easy to use and even gives you information about the senders! Best of all? IT IS FUN! Thank you Danielle and James!

I was one week away from deleting my main email due to being overwhelmed with spam. Leave Me Alone just worked, like way too well. Today I received 8 emails - 8 emails TOTAL! My Promotions folder is sad. I'm pretty happy!
