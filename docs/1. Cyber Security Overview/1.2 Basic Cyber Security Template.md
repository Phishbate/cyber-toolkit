## Cyber Security Template
Cyber security is an integral part of risk management for any organisation. As we increasingly rely on technology to gather, archive and manage information, our vulnerability to the adverse effects of human error, intentionally harmful attacks and system malfunctions increases.

Therefore it is important that all firms become knowledgeable of the best practices in the cyber security industry.

Our Cyber Security Policy document is a template that can be readily tailored to fit your company's needs. If you do not currently have a cyber security policy in effect, we strongly recommend that you implement this policy right away. We recommend that you share this document with all your existing and new staff and implement the same in accordance with your employee policy framework.
