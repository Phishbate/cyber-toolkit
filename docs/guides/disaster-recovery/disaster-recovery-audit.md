## Disaster Recovery Audit
### Disaster Recovery

Conventional wisdom tells us that taking preventative measures is far better than scurrying for a cure. This wisdom applies to implementing and auditing your disaster recovery plan. Although disasters may rarely occur, it is vital that you are prepared for all contingencies.

A critical aspect of risk management is the administration of formal data backup policy and processes in the face of evolving cyber security risks. Data backup involves the copying, storing and possible restoration and recovery of digital resources. It is important that all firms have a set of backup procedures in place, which is documented and tested regularly.

We strongly recommend that you do not allow an external party (with limited liability should there be any adverse occurrences) to assure you that your backups are sufficient. You must inform them that you require frequent tests of the backup system by attempting restoration and recovery of your data. We also recommend that you organise a meeting with your IT support team to configure and test backup solutions.

Please see below a set of backup policies we recommend that you work through with your IT solution provider:

**Basic Protection**

- Daily backups of important information
- Backup stored locally
- Automatic in nature
- Incremental backups of critical information
- Tested at least every quarter

**Advanced Protection**

- Backup stored remotely (server / cloud)
- Tested at least every month
- Backups are encrypted
- Backup process guide

We recommend that you share our Cyber Aware Disaster Recovery Plans with all your management and staff, and also implement the same in accordance with your company's risk management framework.
