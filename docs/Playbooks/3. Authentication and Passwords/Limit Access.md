Administrator accounts provide higher levels of access to your business systems, devices and applications. Examples of what administrator accounts can do, include:

- making changes to the configuration of your systems 
- installing certain types of software  
- adding new users to system applications.

Cyber attackers can cause more damage to your business if they gain access to an administrator account. It is critical to make sure you restrict who has administrator access to the bare minimum.
