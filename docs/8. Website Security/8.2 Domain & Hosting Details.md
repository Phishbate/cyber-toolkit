### Documenting Hosting and Domain Information

It is important that you keep thorough and current documentation of your domain name registration and web hosting details.

This documentation is essential, as it allows you to quickly respond to any of the following possibilities:

- **Changes in your choice of a web designer/developer**: Important information about your domain name and web hosting should not be known only to your current web designer/developer. You may choose to change this professional for a variety of reasons, and proper documentation will facilitate the easy transition from one person to the next.
    
- **Emergency situations**: Proper domain name and website hosting documentation gives you the information that you need to respond to any emergencies (for example a cyber attack). It is always helpful to have as much information as possible to assist in the recovery process.
    
- **Domain name expiration and renewal**: It is important that you renew your domain name registration on time. If your domain name expires, then it can result in all your email and website services becoming unavailable. Proper documentation ensures that you are able to keep track of all such expiration dates.
    
- **Protecting against domain name scams**: These scams tend to be emails that claim your domain name is under threat of being stolen, often requesting either more information or money to prevent the same. You may also be presented with fake renewal invoices. It is important that you have in-depth domain name and web hosting documentation at hand, so that you an spot and avoid such scams.
