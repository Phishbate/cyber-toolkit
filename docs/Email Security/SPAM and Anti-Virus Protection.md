Cyber security experts have found that spam, phishing attempts, and other unsolicited communications account for more than 60% of all emails received. In plain terms, email is the main vehicle that criminals use to spread malware. Fortunately, it is also the easiest area of cyber security to defend.

We recommend activating and familiarising yourself with any email-filtering services offered by your email hosting provider. In addition to this, it’s a good idea to make use of local email filter features, such as Rules on Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail, to ensure that when you _do_ spot a fraudulent email you can prevent the same address from reaching your device again.

We recommend that you contact your service provider and ask them to activate spam / anti-virus protection on your behalf. You can also make use of some advanced protection applications, such as the following:
