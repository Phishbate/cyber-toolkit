# Implement a Password Manager
### Password Managers

Our passwords are keys which open the doors to various digital rooms of our lives. Just as we do not use a single key to open our house, car and office, we have different passwords for our many online sites and resources.  
  
It is also important that each of these keys (or passwords) is unique and strong to prevent unauthorised access, costly identity theft and fraud. This means that we often end up with a bunch of passwords that we struggle to remember for future access.

How do we create and safely keep track of these strong and unique passwords? This is where a password manager comes in! A password manager is software that safely archives all your passwords for your websites and digital resources. The password manager then encrypts (or secretly encodes) your passwords within a secure vault.

You would then create a strong and unique master password which you regularly update. This master password then allows you to automatically access all of your websites and other online resources, meaning that you only have one strong password to remember as opposed to a collection of them.

This not only removes the pressure of _remembering & safely storing_ all of your passwords, but also enables you to create much stronger passwords that are automatically & securely stored in the manager.

You can even have the password manager automatically generate random and secure passwords rather than creating them yourself.

**How do you use a password manager**? You first visit your selected website and navigate to the login page. Instead of typing in your password for the website, you type your master password into the password manager browser extension. The password manager then fills in your correct login credentials for the website, logging you in automatically.

Here are some benefits that you can expect to enjoy from your password manager:

- **Convenience**: You only need to remember a single master password. You can easily login to your accounts, as your master password enables the autofill logins for each site.
    
- **Security**: Not only are your passwords stored securely, your password manager can also generate random passwords for each of your accounts. Some password managers also allow you to reset your passwords and even change them periodically.
    
- **Flexibility**: We all use a range of devices to access the same cyber resources. Many password managers provide password support for your mobile devices.
    

### Please see below a list of the top password manager applications:

Lastpass also provides password support on your mobile devices. This password manager utilizes a two-factor (two-step) authentication process which ensures that your password vault is accessible only to you.

[Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/ "https://www.dashlane.com/")
This is a fairly new password manager, but it has support apps for most operating systems and platforms. It offers the two-factor authentication, as well as the option to share passwords with emergency contacts in the event of that you can't access your accounts.

### What is a Password Manager?

A password manager is an application that securely stores, generates and manages passwords for all your accounts.

With a password manager, you only need to remember one master password, the password manager takes care of the rest.

Think of a password manager as a safe for your passwords and the master password as the key to the safe. You can use password managers on computers and mobile devices.

Password Manager Tips.

TIP #1 - MAKE YOUR MASTER PASSWORD YOUR STRONGEST.

Your master password is the key to your safe. If someone guesses your master password, they may be able to access all your passwords. Make sure your master password is unique and your strongest password.

The strongest type of password is a passphrase which is easy to remember. Passphrases are a combination of random words, for example, ‘crystal onion clay pretzel’. The best passphrases:

- ●  are at least 14 characters long
    
- ●  use a random mix of four or more words
    
- ●  do not use popular phrases, for example, song lyrics or famous
    
    quotes
    
- ●  are not reused across multiple accounts
    
    Passphrases are easy for you to remember and hard for machines to crack.
    

TIP #2 - ENABLE MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION.

Multi-factor authentication is a method of increasing the security of a password manager.

Multi-factor authentication requires you to prove your identity in two or more ways before you can access sensitive features of your password manager. It typically requires a combination of at least two of:

- ●  something you know (e.g. a passphrase or PIN)
    
- ●  something you have (e.g. an authenticator app or physical token) or
    
- ●  something you are (e.g. your fingerprint or face scan).
    
    Enabling multi-factor authentication on your password manager adds an additional layer of security.
    
    It means that even if a cybercriminal learns your master password, they will not be able to access your other passwords as your other authentication methods keep your password manager secure.
    
    TIP #3 - CHOOSE THE RIGHT PASSWORD MANAGER FOR YOU.
    
    When choosing a password manager, do your research to ensure that the vendor has a good reputation and that their product has strong security and privacy features as well as maintained with regular security updates.
    
    Different password managers have different features. Consider what features are important to you. You may want to check if your password manager:
    

- ●  has a plan that covers family members
    
- ●  can manage your passwords across multiple devices
    
- ●  supports all the different devices you use
    
- ●  ensures only you can see your saved passwords, even the company
    
    that makes the password manager cannot see them.
    

Many password managers are free, and some are included with certain devices and programs. If you do, other people that use the device could access your accounts.
