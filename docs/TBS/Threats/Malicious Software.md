[Malware](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/malware "Malware") is a blanket term for malicious software designed to cause harm, such as ransomware, viruses, spyware and trojans. Malware can:

- steal or lock the files on your device
- steal your bank or credit card numbers
- steal your usernames and passwords
- take control of or spy on your computer.

Malware can stop your device from working properly, delete or corrupt your files, or allow others to access your personal or business information. If your device is infected with malware, you could be vulnerable to other attacks. The malware could also spread to other devices on your network.

Your device can be infected by malware in a number of ways, including:

- visiting websites that have been infected by malware
- downloading infected files or software from the internet
- opening infected email attachments.

#### Ransomware

**Ransomware is a common and dangerous type of malware**. It works by locking up or encrypting your files so you can no longer access them. A ransom, usually in the form of cryptocurrency, is demanded to restore access to the files. Cybercriminals might also threaten to publish or sell data online, unless a ransom is paid.

#### Ways to mitigate

While anti-virus or security software can help protect you from malware, no software is 100% effective. Staff must be vigilant with emails, websites and file downloads and regularly update their devices to stay secure.

> ### Case study
> 
> Employees of an auto parts store came into work one morning and were not able to boot their server computer. When their IT provider got access to the server, they found a window open that said all the computer data had been encrypted. The note demanded they pay a ransom in bitcoin to unlock the files.
> 
> There was a backup drive plugged into the computer, which had also been encrypted. They tried to connect more backup drives, but the files were automatically encrypted within seconds. **They had failed to remove the ransomware before attempting to recover their data and lost every backup file they had.**
> 
> The only option left was to factory reset the server and start fresh with a new system. Their business lost many years of data and had to start over.
