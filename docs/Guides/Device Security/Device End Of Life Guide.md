**How to Dispose of Old Computers and Media Safely**

Cyber security and risk management suggest that you should secure your hardware not only while they’re actively used, but also _after_ you’re finished with them. When a device is no longer required, companies often tend to sell, donate or discard it.

However, it is important that _before_ any of the above steps are taken, the device is electronically wiped of all data. There are operating systems that can curate this process through in-system software, and there is a large range of software that can be downloaded for the same purpose.  
  
If for any reason you are unable to electronically wipe your data, namely your drives, you can degauss them instead. Degaussing is physically wiping your data from a drive using a demagnetizing process.

Please see a list of web resources below for the removal of data from hard drives:

We recommend that you have your drives physically removed and destroyed after wiping (or degaussing) them. You can then safely sell, donate, or destroy the rest of your hardware. Here are the websites for some companies that will either crush or shred your hard drives for you:

We recommend that you put a formal process in place to ensure that all end of life devices are disposed of in accordance with the guidelines above.
